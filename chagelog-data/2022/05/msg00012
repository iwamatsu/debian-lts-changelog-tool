Changes:
 waitress (1.0.1-1+deb9u1) stretch-security; urgency=medium
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Security Team.
   * Security updates to fix request smuggling bugs, when combined with another
     http proxy that interprets requests differently. This can lead to a
     potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see
     two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.
     This can result in cache poisoning or unexpected information disclosure.
     The specific issues resolved are:
     - CVE-2019-16785: Only recognise CRLF as a line-terminator, not a plain
       LF. Before this change waitress could see two requests where the
       front-end proxy only saw one.
     - CVE-2019-16786: Waitress would parse the Transfer-Encoding header and
       only look for a single string value, if that value was not "chunked" it
       would fall through and use the Content-Length header instead.
       This could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple
       requests in the case of HTTP pipelining.
     - CVE-2019-16789: Specially crafted requests containing special whitespace
       characters in the Transfer-Encoding header would get parsed by Waitress
       as being a chunked request, but a front-end server would use the
       Content-Length instead as the Transfer-Encoding header is considered
       invalid due to containing invalid characters.
       If a front-end server does HTTP pipelining to a backend Waitress server
       this could lead to HTTP request splitting which may lead to potential
       cache poisoning or unexpected information disclosure.
     - CVE-2019-16792: If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single
       request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby
       treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining.
     - CVE-2022-24761: There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to
       request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory:
       + The use of Python's int() to parse strings into integers, leading to
         +10 to be parsed as 10, or 0x01 to be parsed as 1, where as the
         standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex
         digits.
       + Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding
         them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters.
