 .
   * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Security Team.
   * CVE-2023-39357: When the column type is numeric, the sql_save function
     directly utilizes user input. Many files and functions calling the
     sql_save function do not perform prior validation of user input,
     leading to the existence of multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in
     Cacti. This allows authenticated users to exploit these SQL injection
     vulnerabilities to perform privilege escalation and remote code
     execution.
   * CVE-2023-39360: Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows
     an authenticated user to poison data. The vulnerability is found in
     `graphs_new.php`. Several validations are performed, but the
     `returnto` parameter is directly passed to `form_save_button`. In
     order to bypass this validation, returnto must contain
     `host.php`.
   * CVE-2023-39361: SQL injection discovered in graph_view.php. Since
     guest users can access graph_view.php without authentication by
     default, if guest users are being utilized in an enabled state, there
     could be the potential for significant damage. Attackers may exploit
     this vulnerability, and there may be povssibilities for actions such as
     the usurpation of administrative privileges or remote code execution.
   * CVE-2023-39362: An authenticated privileged user, can use a malicious
     string in the SNMP options of a Device, performing command injection
     and obtaining remote code execution on the underlying server. The
     `lib/snmp.php` file has a set of functions, with similar behavior,
     that accept in input some variables and place them into an `exec` call
     without a proper escape or validation.
   * CVE-2023-39364: Users with console access can be redirected to an
     arbitrary website after a change password performed via a specifically
     crafted URL. The `auth_changepassword.php` file accepts `ref` as a URL
     parameter and reflects it in the form used to perform the change
     password. It's value is used to perform a redirect via `header` PHP
     function. A user can be tricked in performing the change password
     operation, e.g., via a phishing message, and then interacting with the
     malicious website where the redirection has been performed, e.g.,
     downloading malwares, providing credentials, etc.
   * CVE-2023-39365: Issues with Cacti Regular Expression validation
     combined with the external links feature can lead to limited SQL
     Injections and subsequent data leakage.
   * CVE-2023-39513: Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which
     allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s
     database. The script under `host.php` is used to monitor and manage
     hosts in the _cacti_ app, hence displays useful information such as
     data queries and verbose logs.
   * CVE-2023-39515: Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows
     an authenticated user to poison data stored in the cacti's
     database. These data will be viewed by administrative cacti accounts
     and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The
     script under `data_debug.php` displays data source related debugging
     information such as _data source paths, polling settings, meta-data on
     the data source_.
   * CVE-2023-39516: Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which
     allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s
     database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts
     and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The
     script under `data_sources.php` displays the data source management
     information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration etc.) for
     different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app.
   * CVE-2023-49084: While using the detected SQL Injection and
     insufficient processing of the include file path, it is possible to
     execute arbitrary code on the server. Exploitation of the
     vulnerability is possible for an authorized user. The vulnerable
     component is the `link.php`. (Closes: #1059254)
   * CVE-2023-49085: It is possible to execute arbitrary SQL code through
     the `pollers.php` script. An authorized user may be able to execute
     arbitrary SQL code. The vulnerable component is the `pollers.php`.
   * CVE-2023-49086: Bypassing an earlier fix (CVE-2023-39360) that leads
     to a DOM XSS attack. Exploitation of the vulnerability is possible for
     an authorized user. The vulnerable component is the
     `graphs_new.php`. (Closes: #1059254)
   * CVE-2023-49088: The fix applied for CVE-2023-39515 in version 1.2.25
     is incomplete as it enables an adversary to have a victim browser
     execute malicious code when a victim user hovers their mouse over the
     malicious data source path in `data_debug.php`.
