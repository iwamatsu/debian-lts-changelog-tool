Changes:
 postgresql-13 (13.17-0+deb11u1) bullseye-security; urgency=medium
 .
   * New upstream version 13.17.
 .
     + Ensure cached plans are marked as dependent on the calling role when RLS
       applies to a non-top-level table reference (Nathan Bossart)
 .
       If a CTE, subquery, sublink, security invoker view, or coercion
       projection in a query references a table with row-level security
       policies, we neglected to mark the resulting plan as potentially
       dependent on which role is executing it.  This could lead to later query
       executions in the same session using the wrong plan, and then returning
       or hiding rows that should have been hidden or returned instead.
 .
       The PostgreSQL Project thanks Wolfgang Walther for reporting this
       problem. (CVE-2024-10976)
 .
     + Make libpq discard error messages received during SSL or GSS protocol
       negotiation (Jacob Champion)
 .
       An error message received before encryption negotiation is completed
       might have been injected by a man-in-the-middle, rather than being real
       server output.  Reporting it opens the door to various security hazards;
       for example, the message might spoof a query result that a careless user
       could mistake for correct output.  The best answer seems to be to
       discard such data and rely only on libpq's own report of the connection
       failure.

       (CVE-2024-10977)
 .
     + Fix unintended interactions between SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION and SET
       ROLE (Tom Lane)
 .
       The SQL standard mandates that SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION have a
       side-effect of doing SET ROLE NONE.  Our implementation of that was
       flawed, creating more interaction between the two settings than
       intended. Notably, rolling back a transaction that had done SET SESSION
       AUTHORIZATION would revert ROLE to NONE even if that had not been the
       previous state, so that the effective user ID might now be different
       from what it had been before the transaction.  Transiently setting
       session_authorization in a function SET clause had a similar effect. A
       related bug was that if a parallel worker inspected
       current_setting('role'), it saw none even when it should see something
       else.

       (CVE-2024-10978)
 .
     + Prevent trusted PL/Perl code from changing environment variables
       (Andrew Dunstan, Noah Misch)
 .
       The ability to manipulate process environment variables such as PATH
       gives an attacker opportunities to execute arbitrary code.  Therefore,
       trusted PLs must not offer the ability to do that.  To fix plperl,
       replace %ENV with a tied hash that rejects any modification attempt with
       a warning. Untrusted plperlu retains the ability to change the
       environment.
 .
       The PostgreSQL Project thanks Coby Abrams for reporting this problem.
