   * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS team.
   * d/gbp.conf: set debian-branch
   * d/.gitlab-ci.yml: add CI setup
   * CVE-2021-32686
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     A race condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted socket
     having no group lock. Additionally, the SSL socket parent/listener may get
     destroyed during handshake. Both issues were reported to happen
     intermittently in heavy load TLS connections. They cause a crash, resulting
     in a denial of service.
   * CVE-2021-37706
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     If the incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the header
     length is not checked before performing a subtraction operation, potentially
     resulting in an integer underflow scenario. This issue affects all users
     that use STUN. A malicious actor located within the victim's network may
     forge and send a specially crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely
     execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine.
   * CVE-2021-43299, CVE-2021-43300, CVE-2021-43301, CVE-2021-43302 and
     CVE-2021-43303
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by these CVEs.
     An attacker-controlled 'filename' argument may cause a buffer overflow since
     it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without any size validation.
   * CVE-2021-43804
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     In affected versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's
     length, this declared length is not checked against the actual received
     packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access.
   * CVE-2021-43845
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     If incoming RTCP XR message contain block, the data field is not checked
     against the received packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound
     read access.
   * CVE-2022-21722
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     There are various cases where it is possible that certain incoming RTP/RTCP
     packets can potentially cause out-of-bound read access.
   * CVE-2022-21723
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     Parsing an incoming SIP message that contains a malformed multipart can
     potentially cause out-of-bound read access.
   * CVE-2022-23537
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     Buffer overread is possible when parsing a specially crafted STUN message
     with unknown attribute.
   * CVE-2022-23547
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     Possible buffer overread when parsing a certain STUN message.
   * CVE-2022-23608
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     When in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple
     UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is
     destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash
     table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined
     behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless
     loop.
   * CVE-2022-24754
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     There is a stack-buffer overflow vulnerability which only impacts PJSIP
     users who accept hashed digest credentials (credentials with data_type
     `PJSIP_CRED_DATA_DIGEST`).
   * CVE-2022-24763
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     A denial-of-service vulnerability affects PJSIP users that consume PJSIP's
     XML parsing in their apps.
   * CVE-2022-24764
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     A stack buffer overflow vulnerability affects PJSUA2 users or users that
     call the API `pjmedia_sdp_print(), pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`.
   * CVE-2022-24793
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     A buffer overflow vulnerability in affects applications that use PJSIP DNS
     resolution.
   * CVE-2022-31031
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     A stack buffer overflow vulnerability affects PJSIP users that use STUN in
     their applications, either by: setting a STUN server in their account/media
     config in PJSUA/PJSUA2 level, or directly using `pjlib-util/stun_simple`
     API.
   * CVE-2022-39244.patch
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     The PJSIP parser, PJMEDIA RTP decoder, and PJMEDIA SDP parser are affeced
     by a buffer overflow vulnerability. Users connecting to untrusted clients
     are at risk.
   * CVE-2023-27585
     The embedded copy of pjproject is affected by this CVE.
     A buffer overflow vulnerability affects applications that use PJSIP DNS
     resolver.
