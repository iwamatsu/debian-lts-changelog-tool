   * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Team.
   * CVE-2022-27774:
     An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in curl that
     could allow an attacker to extract credentials when follows HTTP(S)
     redirects is used with authentication could leak credentials to other
     services that exist on different protocols or port numbers.
   * Follow up to CVE-2022-27782:
     The patch included to address this CVE in 7.64.0-4+deb10u3 contained a
     defect which resulted in the vulnerability being completely addressed.  The
     patch is corrected and the vulberability is fully addressed in this version.
   * CVE-2022-32221:
     When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read
     callback (CURLOPT_READFUNCTION) to ask for data to send, even when the
     CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS option has been set, if the same handle previously was
     used to issue a PUT request which used that callback.
   * CVE-2022-35252:
     When curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from a HTTP(S) server,
     it accepts cookies using control codes that when later are sent back to a
     HTTP server might make the server return 400 responses. Effectively
     allowing a "sister site" to deny service to all siblings.
   * CVE-2022-43552:
     HTTP Proxy deny use-after-free
