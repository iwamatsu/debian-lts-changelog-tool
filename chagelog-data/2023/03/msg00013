 .
   * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Security Team.
   * CVE-2020-14394: An infinite loop flaw was found in the USB xHCI
     controller emulation of QEMU while computing the length of the
     Transfer Request Block (TRB) Ring. This flaw allows a privileged guest
     user to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
     service. (Closes: #979677)
   * CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2021-3409: A heap-based buffer overflow was found
     in QEMU in the SDHCI device emulation support. It could occur while
     doing a multi block SDMA transfer via the
     sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() routine in hw/sd/sdhci.c. A guest
     user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the
     host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially
     execute arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on the
     host. (Closes: #970937, #986795)
   * CVE-2020-29130: slirp.c has a buffer over-read because it tries to
     read a certain amount of header data even if that exceeds the total
     packet length.
   * CVE-2021-3592: An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in
     the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
     bootp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet
     that is smaller than the size of the 'bootp_t' structure. A malicious
     guest could use this flaw to leak 10 bytes of uninitialized heap
     memory from the host. (Closes: #989993)
   * CVE-2021-3593: An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in
     the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
     udp6_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet
     that is smaller than the size of the 'udphdr' structure. This issue
     may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory
     disclosure to the guest. (Closes: #989994)
   * CVE-2021-3594: An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in
     the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
     udp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet
     that is smaller than the size of the 'udphdr' structure. This issue
     may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory
     disclosure to the guest. (Closes: #989995)
   * CVE-2021-3595: An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in
     the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
     tftp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet
     that is smaller than the size of the 'tftp_t' structure. This issue
     may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory
     disclosure to the guest. (Closes: #989996)
   * CVE-2022-0216: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the
     LSI53C895A SCSI Host Bus Adapter emulation of QEMU. The flaw occurs
     while processing repeated messages to cancel the current SCSI request
     via the lsi_do_msgout function. This flaw allows a malicious
     privileged user within the guest to crash the QEMU process on the
     host, resulting in a denial of service. (Closes: #1014590)
   * CVE-2022-1050: A flaw was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's
     paravirtual RDMA device. This flaw allows a crafted guest driver to
     execute HW commands when shared buffers are not yet allocated,
     potentially leading to a use-after-free condition. (Closes: #1014589)
