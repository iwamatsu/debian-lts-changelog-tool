   * Add salsa testsuite
   * CVE-2022-26307: add Initialization Vectors to password storage.
     LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in
     the user’s configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted
     with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice
     existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its
     entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulerable to a
     brute force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored
     config.
   * fix CVE-2022-26306: LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for
     web connections in the user’s configuration database. The stored
     passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the
     user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where the required initialization
     vector for encryption was always the same which weakens the security
     of the encryption making them vulnerable if an attacker has access to
     the user's configuration data
   * CVE-2022-26305: compare authors using Thumbprint
     An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice
     existed where determining if a macro was signed by a trusted author
     was done by only matching the serial number and issuer string of the
     used certificate with that of a trusted certificate. This is not
     sufficient to verify that the macro was actually signed with the
     certificate. An adversary could therefore create an arbitrary
     certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical to a
     trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to
     the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute
     arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted.
   * CVE-2021-25636: only use X509Data
     LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros
     within documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the
     document occurred since the last signing and that the signature is
     valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice
     allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by
     manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream
     within the document to contain both "X509Data" and "KeyValue" children
     of the "KeyInfo" tag, which when opened caused LibreOffice to verify
     using the "KeyValue" but to report verification with the unrelated
     "X509Data" value.
   * CVE-2022-3140: Insufficient validation of "vnd.libreoffice.command"
     URI schemes. LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser
     integration of LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional
     scheme 'vnd.libreoffice.command' specific to LibreOffice was added. In
     the affected versions of LibreOffice links using that scheme could be
     constructed to call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. Which
     when clicked on, or activated by document events, could result in
     arbitrary script execution without warning.
