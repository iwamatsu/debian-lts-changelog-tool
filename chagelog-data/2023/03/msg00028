   * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS team.
   * Fix CVE-2022-3204:
     A vulnerability named 'Non-Responsive Delegation Attack' (NRDelegation
     Attack) has been discovered in various DNS resolving software. The
     NRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a
     considerable number of non responsive nameservers. The attack starts by
     querying a resolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive
     nameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of
     time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point where a
     considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can trigger high
     CPU usage in some resolver implementations that continually look in the
     cache for resolved NS records in that delegation. This can lead to degraded
     performance and eventually denial of service in orchestrated attacks.
     Unbound does not suffer from high CPU usage, but resources are still needed
     for resolving the malicious delegation. Unbound will keep trying to resolve
     the record until hard limits are reached. Based on the nature of the attack
     and the replies, different limits could be reached. From now on Unbound
     introduces fixes for better performance when under load, by cutting
     opportunistic queries for nameserver discovery and DNSKEY prefetching and
     limiting the number of times a delegation point can issue a cache lookup
     for missing records.
   * Fix CVE-2022-30698 and CVE-2022-30699:
     NLnet Labs Unbound is vulnerable to a novel type of the "ghost domain
     names" attack. The vulnerability works by targeting an Unbound instance.
     Unbound is queried for a rogue domain name when the cached delegation
     information is about to expire. The rogue nameserver delays the response so
     that the cached delegation information is expired. Upon receiving the
     delayed answer containing the delegation information, Unbound overwrites
     the now expired entries. This action can be repeated when the delegation
     information is about to expire making the rogue delegation information
     ever-updating. From now on Unbound stores the start time for a query and
     uses that to decide if the cached delegation information can be
     overwritten.
   * Fix CVE-2020-28935:
     Unbound contains a local vulnerability that would allow for a local symlink
     attack. When writing the PID file Unbound creates the file if it is not
     there, or opens an existing file for writing. In case the file was already
     present, it would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink
     instead of a regular file.
