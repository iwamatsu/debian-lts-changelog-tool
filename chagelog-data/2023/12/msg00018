 .
   * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Team.
   * Enable autopkgtest
   * Add salsa-ci testing
   * Fix regresion on CVE-2019-10206
   * Fix CVE-2021-3447: A flaw was found in several
     ansible modules, where parameters containing credentials,
     such as secrets, were being logged in plain-text on
     managed nodes, as well as being made visible on the
     controller node when run in verbose mode. These parameters
     were not protected by the no_log feature. An attacker can
     take advantage of this information to steal those credentials,
     provided when they have access to the log files
     containing them. The highest threat from this vulnerability
     is to data confidentiality
   * Fix CVE-2021-3583: A flaw was found in Ansible, where
     a user's controller is vulnerable to template injection.
     This issue can occur through facts used in the template
     if the user is trying to put templates in multi-line YAML
     strings and the facts being handled do not routinely
     include special template characters. This flaw allows
     attackers to perform command injection, which discloses
     sensitive information. The highest threat from this
     vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.
   * Fix CVE-2021-3620: A flaw was found in Ansible Engine's
     ansible-connection module, where sensitive information
     such as the Ansible user credentials is disclosed by
     default in the traceback error message. The highest
     threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.
   * Fix CVE-2021-20178: A flaw was found in ansible module
     snmp_fact where credentials are disclosed in the console log by
     default and not protected by the security feature
     This flaw allows an attacker to steal privkey and authkey
     credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability
     is to confidentiality.
   * CVE-2021-20191: A flaw was found in ansible. Credentials,
     such as secrets, are being disclosed in console log by default
     and not protected by no_log feature when using Cisco nxos moduel.
     An attacker can take advantage of this information to steal those
     credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
     to data confidentiality.
   * CVE-2022-3697: A flaw was found in Ansible in the amazon.aws
     collection when using the tower_callback parameter from the
     amazon.aws.ec2_instance module. This flaw allows an attacker
     to take advantage of this issue as the module is handling the
     parameter insecurely, leading to the password leaking in the logs.
   * CVE-2023-5115: An absolute path traversal attack existed
     in the Ansible automation platform. This flaw allows an
     attacker to craft a malicious Ansible role and make the
     victim execute the role. A symlink can be used to
     overwrite a file outside of the extraction path.
