 .
   * Team upload by LTS security team.
   * Fix CVE-2023-6185: An Improper Input Validation vulnerability
     was found in GStreamer integration of The Document
     Foundation LibreOffice allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
     GStreamer plugins. In affected versions the filename of the
     embedded video is not sufficiently escaped when passed to
     GStreamer enabling an attacker to run arbitrary
     gstreamer plugins depending on what plugins are installed
     on the target system.
   * Fix CVE-2023-6186: LibreOffice supports hyperlinks.
     In addition to the typical common protocols such as
     http/https hyperlinks can also have target URLs that
     can launch built-in macros or dispatch built-in
     internal commands. In affected version of LibreOffice
     there are scenarios where these can be executed without warning
     if the user activates such hyperlinks. In later versions
     the users's explicit macro execution permissions
     for the document are now consulted if these non-typical
     hyperlinks can be executed. The possibility to use these
     variants of hyperlink targets for floating frames has been removed.
   * Fix CVE-2020-12802: LibreOffice has a 'stealth mode' in which only
     documents from locations deemed 'trusted' are allowed to
     retrieve remote resources. This mode is not the default mode,
     but can be enabled by users who want to disable LibreOffice's ability
     to include remote resources within a document. A flaw existed
     where remote graphic links loaded from docx documents were omitted
     from this protection.
   * Fix CVE-2020-12801: If LibreOffice has an encrypted document
     open and crashes, that document is auto-saved encrypted.
     On restart, LibreOffice offers to restore the document
     and prompts for the password to decrypt it. If the recovery
     is successful, and if the file format of the recovered document
     was not LibreOffice's default ODF file format, then affected versions
     of LibreOffice default that subsequent saves of the document
     are unencrypted. This may lead to a user accidentally saving
     a MSOffice file format document unencrypted while believing
     it to be encrypted.
   * Fix CVE-2020-12803: ODF documents can contain forms to be
     filled out by the user. Similar to HTML forms, the contained
     form data can be submitted to a URI, for example, to an external
     web server. To create submittable forms, ODF implements the
     XForms W3C standard, which allows data to be submitted without
     the need for macros or other active scripting. LibreOffice allowed
     forms to be submitted to any URI, including file: URIs, enabling
     form submissions to overwrite local files. User-interaction
     is required to submit the form, but to avoid the possibility
     of malicious documents engineered to maximize the possibility of
     inadvertent user submission this feature has now been limited to
     http[s] URIs, removing the possibility to overwrite local files.
