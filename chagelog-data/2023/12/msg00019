   * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS team.
   * Fix CVE-2023-37457:
     The 'update' functionality of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can exceed
     the available buffer space for storing the new value of a header. By doing
     so this can overwrite memory or cause a crash. This is not externally
     exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly written to update a header based
     on data from an outside source. If the 'update' functionality is not used
     the vulnerability does not occur.
   * Fix CVE-2023-38703:
     PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
     C with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a
     higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media
     transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not
     synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce a
     use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have
     SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media
     transport other than UDP. This vulnerabilityâ€™s impact may range from
     unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory
     corruption.
   * Fix CVE-2023-49294:
     It is possible to read any arbitrary file even when the `live_dangerously`
     option is not enabled.
   * Fix CVE-2023-49786:
     Asterisk is susceptible to a DoS due to a race condition in the hello
     handshake phase of the DTLS protocol when handling DTLS-SRTP for media
     setup. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP
     encrypted calls during the attack. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to
     a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that
     rely on DTLS-SRTP.
