 .
   * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS team.
   * Fix CVE-2023-27533:
     A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl during
     communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on
     maliciously crafted user name and "telnet options" during server
     negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send
     content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent.
     This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input,
     thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.
   * Fix CVE-2023-27535:
     An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the FTP
     connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used
     during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a
     connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain
     FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
     CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the
     configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could
     lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,
     potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
   * CVE-2023-27536:
     An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the
     connection reuse feature which can reuse previously established connections
     with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for changes in
     the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects
     krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in
     unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not
     reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed.
   * Fix CVE-2023-27538:
     An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl where it
     reuses a previously established SSH connection despite the fact that an SSH
     option was modified, which should have prevented reuse. libcurl maintains a
     pool of previously used connections to reuse them for subsequent transfers
     if the configurations match. However, two SSH settings were omitted from
     the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading
     to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.
