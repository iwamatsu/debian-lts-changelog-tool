   * Collection of minor security updates for Ceph.
   * CVE-2020-27781: Privilege Escalation: User credentials could be manipulated
     and stolen by Native CephFS consumers of OpenStack Manila, resulting in
     potential privilege escalation. An Open Stack Manila user can request
     access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user, including existing users.
     The access key is retrieved via the interface drivers. Then, all users of
     the requesting OpenStack project can view the access key. This enables the
     attacker to target any resource that the user has access to. This can be
     done to even "admin" users, compromising the ceph administrator.
   * CVE-2021-20288: Potential Privilege Escalation: When handling
     CEPHX_GET_PRINCIPAL_SESSION_KEY requests, ignore CEPH_ENTITY_TYPE_AUTH in
     CephXServiceTicketRequest::keys.
   * CVE-2020-1760: XSS: A flaw was found in the Ceph Object Gateway, where it
     supports request sent by an anonymous user in Amazon S3. This flaw could
     lead to potential XSS attacks due to the lack of proper neutralization of
     untrusted input.
   * CVE-2020-25678: Information Disclosure: ceph stores mgr module passwords
     in clear text. This can be found by searching the mgr logs for grafana and
     dashboard, with passwords visible.
   * CVE-2019-10222: Denial of service: An unauthenticated attacker could crash
     the Ceph RGW server by sending valid HTTP headers and terminating the
     connection, resulting in a remote denial of service for Ceph RGW clients.
   * CVE-2020-10753 and CVE-2021-3524: Header Injection: It was possible to
     inject HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag in an Amazon S3 bucket. The
     newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file
     generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is
     made.
   * CVE-2020-12059: Denial of Service: A POST request with an invalid tagging
     XML could crash the RGW process by triggering a NULL pointer exception.
   * CVE-2020-1700: Denial of Service: A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW
     Beast front-end handles unexpected disconnects. An authenticated attacker
     can abuse this flaw by making multiple disconnect attempts resulting in a
     permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead to
     a denial of service condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually
     leading to the exhaustion of available resources, preventing legitimate
     users from connecting to the system.
   * CVE-2021-3531: Denial of Service: When processing a GET Request in Ceph
     Storage RGW for a swift URL that ends with two slashes it could cause the
     rgw to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
   * CVE-2021-3979: Loss of Confidentiality: A key length flaw was found in
     Ceph Storage. An attacker could exploit the fact that the key length is
     incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key,
     which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and
     integrity on encrypted disks.
 .
   [ Bastien Roucariès ]
 .
   * CVE-2023-43040: A flaw was found in Ceph RGW. An unprivileged
     user can write to any bucket(s) accessible by a given key
     if a POST's form-data contains a key called 'bucket'
     with a value matching the name of the bucket used to sign
     the request. The result of this is that a user could actually
     upload to any bucket accessible by the specified access key
     as long as the bucket in the POST policy matches the bucket
     in said POST form part. (Closes: #1053690)
