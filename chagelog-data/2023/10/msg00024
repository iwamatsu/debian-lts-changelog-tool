 .
   * Team upload.
   * Fix CVE-2023-45648: Request smuggling. Tomcat did not correctly parse HTTP
     trailer headers. A specially crafted, invalid trailer header could cause
     Tomcat to treat a single request as multiple requests leading to the
     possibility of request smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.
   * Fix CVE-2023-44487: DoS caused by HTTP/2 frame overhead (Rapid Reset Attack)
   * Fix CVE-2023-42795: Information Disclosure. When recycling various internal
     objects, including the request and the response, prior to re-use by the
     next request/response, an error could cause Tomcat to skip some parts of
     the recycling process leading to information leaking from the current
     request/response to the next.
   * Fix CVE-2023-41080: Open redirect. If the ROOT (default) web application
     is configured to use FORM authentication then it is possible that a
     specially crafted URL could be used to trigger a redirect to an URL of the
     attackers choice.
   * Fix CVE-2023-28709: Denial of Service. If non-default HTTP connector
     settings were used such that the maxParameterCount could be reached using
     query string parameters and a request was submitted that supplied exactly
     maxParameterCount parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded
     request parts could be bypassed with the potential for a denial of service
     to occur.
   * Fix CVE-2023-24998: Denial of service. Tomcat uses a packaged renamed copy
     of Apache Commons FileUpload to provide the file upload functionality
     defined in the Jakarta Servlet specification. Apache Tomcat was, therefore,
     also vulnerable to the Commons FileUpload vulnerability CVE-2023-24998 as
     there was no limit to the number of request parts processed. This resulted
     in the possibility of an attacker triggering a DoS with a malicious upload
     or series of uploads.
