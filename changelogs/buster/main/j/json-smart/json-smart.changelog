json-smart (2.2-2+deb10u1) buster-security; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS team.
  * CVE-2023-1370: stack overflow due to excessive recursion
    When reaching a ‘[‘ or ‘{‘ character in the JSON input, the code
    parses an array or an object respectively. It was discovered that the
    code does not have any limit to the nesting of such arrays or
    objects. Since the parsing of nested arrays and objects is done
    recursively, nesting too many of them can cause a stack exhaustion
    (stack overflow) and crash the software. (Closes: #1033474)
  * CVE-2021-31684: Fix indexOf
    A vulnerability was discovered in the indexOf function of
    JSONParserByteArray in JSON Smart versions 1.3 and 2.4
    which causes a denial of service (DOS)
    via a crafted web request.
