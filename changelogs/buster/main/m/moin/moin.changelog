moin (1.8.0.beta1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream prerelease.
  * Add leading dot to Debian representation of upstream prereleases (to
    keep it lower than final release) in debian/rules and watch file.
  * Disable patch 10001 (disable RenderAsDocbook if no xml) as upstream
    config parsing code has changed: patch needs a complete rewrite!
  * Drop installing example code phpwiki_migration: Dropped upstream.

moin (1.7.1-2) never-really-releasedq; urgency=low

    dh_installinit.  See bug#494288.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Fri, 08 Aug 2008 13:38:17 +0200

moin (1.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Closes: bug#492233, thanks to Teodor.
    + Fixes bogus empty page creation.  Closes: bug#489146, thanks to
      Sam Morris.
  * Recommend python-xml, needed for RSS feeds.  Closes: bug#488777,
    thanks to Sam Morris.
  * Add patch 10001 to disable RenderAsDocbook if python-xml is not
    available. Closes: bug#487741, thanks to Franklin Piat.

moin (1.7.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplify /etc/moin/wikilist format: "USER URL" (drop unneeded middle
    CONFIG_DIR that was wrongly advertised as DATA_DIR).  Make
    moin-mass-migrate handle both formats and warn about deprecation of
    the old one.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 22 Jun 2008 21:17:13 +0200

moin (1.7.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add NEWS item (targeted for upstream 1.7.0 release) about need for
    migration.  Bump firstcompat migration hint in postinst.
  * Suggest python-pyxmpp.
  * Recommend webserver packages (instead of suggesting them).  Favor
    apache2, and rewrite README.Debian example to use apache2.  Add
    python-twisted-web, libapache-mod-fcgid and libapache2-mod-fastcgi
    as fallback recommendations.  Stop recommending apache (provided by
    httpd-cgi).
  * Drop conflicting/replacing moin (even oldstable has
    python-moinmoin).
  * Merge moinmoin-common into python-moinmoin.
    Rationale: separation of common stuff was no longer needed when
    Python policy 2 made it possible to provide a single binary package
    for all supported versions of Python.  On the other hand it didn't
    hurt anything either.
    When the mass-migration routine was recently added, it got tied to
    the wrong package.  Instead of adding even more complexity, it makes
    better sense to simplify instead.
  * Install the "moin" script normally (not as example script).  Closes:
    bug#487511, thanks to Franklin Piat.
  * Fix servertweaks sed rules to properly hardcode configdir /etc/moin
    for the various server scripts.  Closes: bug#487507, thanks to
    Franklin Piat.
  * Add patch 20002 to hardcode configdir /etc/moin for "moin" script.
  * Improve README.Debian example to setup wikilist, and improve
    wikilist commented out example to match README.Debian.  Closes:
    bug#487531, thanks to Franklin Piat.
  * Fix wikilist header comment to talk about data dir (not config dir).
  * Semi-auto-update debian/control to update dependencies:
      DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL=yes fakeroot debian/rules clean

    bug#486473, thanks to Sam Morris.

      bug#487073, thanks to Lucas Nussbaum.
    + Update dependency cleanup to strip cdbs 0.4.27 (not 0.4.27-1).
  * Semi-auto-update debian/control to update build-dependencies:
      DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL=yes fakeroot debian/rules clean

    + Stitch together README.Debian and  moinmoin-common.postinst in
      pre-build, and remove in clean. This avoids distributing changes
      and then loosing it again automatically at next build.

    distributions.
  * Tightened pyversions to only include 2.3 and higher.

    files a little.  Remove a useless use of cat.

moin (1.4.99+1.5.0beta4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Improve wording of use of non-default Python versions in
    README.Debian (thanks to Michael Schmitt <TCW@unixkiste.org>).
  * Refer to specific further reading beyond the simple exaple setup
    in README.Debian.
  * Drop python2.2-moinmoin - it might still work but too little tested
    for upstream to support it.
  * Drop support for woody backports.
  * Include new doc files docs/CHANGES.config and docs/HACKS.
  * Improve debian/copyright:
    + Added ReStructured Text Parser: GPL.
    + Added FCKeditor: LGPL.
    + Added daemon.py: BSD-like.
    + Added thfcgi.py: GPL.
    + Added NetRube_Upload: Free use.
    + Added wz_jsgraphics: GPL.
    + Added IE7: LGPL.
    + Added phpwiki2moinmoin: GPL.
  * Strip Mega Upload and other unused parts of FCKeditor from source,
    as suggested by upstream of FCKeditor.
  * Strip cplusplus and java parser modules from source, as licensing
    info is simply "all rights reserved".
  * Add new cdbs snippet to check at build time for changed copyright
    notices.
  * Strip irrelevant parts of FCKeditor, and move documentation parts
    below below /usr/share/doc/.../FCKeditor/ .
  * Add note to NEWS about loads of config changes requiring manual
    adjustments after examining upstream changelog.
  * Add notes to TODO about things I should do before final release but
    haven't found time to do yet...
  * Drop a TODO note about fixing a cache bug: Can't even reproduce it
    myself anymore, so probably fixed upstream already without my
    reporting it :-P .

    internet access in the build environment :-P ).
  * Bump up standards-version to 3.6.2.
  * Improve notes on simple sample setup in README.Debian:
    + Store data below outside webroot to avoid leaking private info.
      Closes: bug#308764 (thanks to Olivier Sessink
      <lists@olivier.pk.wau.nl>).
    + Setup underlay.
    + Mention (briefly) non-Apache setups.

moin (1.3.4.really.1.3.5rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream prerelease.
  * Use pristine source again (I believe it is ok to distribute the java
    binary with source when its source is included too - a fresh compile
    for inclusion in a binary package is still on the TODO).
  * Add small note pointing an unofficial home of TwikiDrawPlugin at

  * Small update to german (de) locale. Closes: bug#313952 (thanks to
    Jens Seidel <jensseidel@users.sf.net>).
  * Update local python cdbs snippet (and manually strip spurious build-
    dependency build-essential due to bug#316034).
  * Only do cdbs debian/rules auto-update when DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=update.
  * Patch action/SpellCheck.py to fallback to iso8859-1 encoded dicts.
  * Tweak paths in all patches to apply in first attempt by cdbs.
  * Fix XSLT brokennes (using info found here:
    http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/MoinMoinBugs/XsltParserOnDebian ).
    Actually - it is still broken to me, but at least the error is now a
    different one (and may only relate to the XsltVersion test page)...
  * Strip comments in underlay about only editing on masterwiki
    (especially for templates they are confusing).

moin (1.3.4-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Run dh-python a bit earlier (bug#172283 resurfacing) to get python
    code optimized at install time. (this breaks woody backport support
    but that was already broken anyway).
  * Include unversioned python-gdchart suggestion only for
    python2.3-moinmoin package.
  * Set urgency=medium as the changes are small but the gain is high.

moin (1.3.4-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Drop transitional binary package "moin", as it is only relevant for
    users of testing and unstable, and there it causes unpleasant
    surprises more(?) than it helps. Closes: bug#304054, #303957 (thanks
    to Toni Mueller <support@oeko.net> and others).
  * Improve migration section of README.Debian and refer NEWS item to
    that instead of directly to README.migration. Closes: bug#204146
    (thanks to Markku Tavasti <tavasti@tavastisolutions.com> and Aaron
    Bentley <aaron.bentley@utoronto.ca>).
  * Remove TODO item related to the above.
  * Force using/aoviding specific python version also for scripts
    installed as part of the library.
  * Set urgency=high as these changes (together with removing the old
    "moin" package from the archive) "fixes" breakage of existing
    unstable and testing moin installs.

    does it.
  * Simply have a rule for each of woody, sarge and ubuntu, untied to
    the standard build to force switch distro and then stay with it.
  * Hardcode dependencies for library packages (dh_python is broken:
    adds dependency always on default python).
  * Make scripts executable.

moin (1.3.4-1.0.jones.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle ubuntu and woody builds as DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.

  * Correct hashbang-line in example files of library packages.
  * Improve python cdbs snippet, and setup variables in separate one.

  * New upstream release. Closes: bug#287006, #291527 (thanks for the

    + XMLRPC fixed. Closes: bug#285555, #285672 (thanks to Kai Weber
      <kai.weber@glorybox.de> and Christian Grigis <glove@grigri.org>).
  * Extend dependency on http daemons to include libapache2-mod-python.
  * Drop some patches (for arguments on remaining patches see
    http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/DebianPatches ):
    + Adopted upstream:
      - 06_interwiki_update.diff
      - 07_avoid_hardcoded_pythonversion.patch
      - 21_danish_locale_fixup.diff
      - 22_danish_locale_update.diff
    + Possibly too tight for some (preserved in source tarball):
      - 01avoid_world_write_access.diff
    + Implemented differently upstream:
      - 03_enable_farm_config.diff
    + Obsolete:

    dropped - see above).
  * Use local cdbs snippet to invoke dh_buildinfo.
  * Rename NEWS.Debian to NEWS to get properly installed.
  * Patch MoinMoin/i18n to not fail if cleaned files doesn't exist (and
    include the patch in source below debian/prepatches).
  * Fix cdbs hint to not compress example Python scripts.
  * Use CHANGES (not the more verbose Changelog) as upstream changelog.
  * Add patch 24_twikidraw_strip_cr.diff. Closes: bug#297960 (thanks to
    Pedro Zorzenon Neto <pzn@terra.com.br>).

moin (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    Fixes:
    + fixed "None" pagename bug in fullsearch/titlesearch.
    + fixed projection CSS usage.
    + the compiled page is removed when a page is deleted, so no ghost
      page appears after deletion.
    + fixed AbandonedPages day-break problem.
    + fixed [[GetVal(WikiDict,key)]].
    + the msg box is now outside content div on PageEditor, too.
    + privacy fix for email notifications: you don't see other email
      addresses in To: any more. mail_from is now also used for To:
      header field, but we don't really send email to that address.
    + privacy fix for /MoinEditorBackup pages that were made on previews
      of pages that were not saved in the end.
    + fix double content div on PageEditor preview.
    Other changes:
    + workaround for broken Microsoft Internet Explorer, the page editor
      now stops expanding to the right (e.g. with rightsidebar theme).
      Nevertheless it is a very good idea to use a non-broken and more
      secure browser like Mozilla, Firefox or Opera!
    + from MoinMoin.util.antispam import SecurityPolicy in your
      moin_config.py will protect your wiki from at least the known
      spammers. See MoinMoin:AntiSpamGlobalSolution for details.
    + xmlrpc plugin for usage logging, currently used for antispam
      accesses.
    + (re-)added some configurable meta tags.
    + i18n updates/fixes, new: nb.
    + New UserPreferences switch:
      you may subscribe to trivial changes (when you want to be notified
      about ALL changes to pages, even if the author deselected to send
      notifications). This closes: bug#269456 (thanks to Laurent Fousse
      <laurent@komite.net> for the - slightly different - patch).
    + New AttachList and AttachInfo macros - thanks to Nigel
      Metheringham and Jacob Cohen.
  * Update TODO (one wish solved in the new upstream release).
  * Update danish locale.
  * Add (commented out) new antispam setting to farm_config.py.
  * Patch to avoid hardcoded python version (thanks to my own clever
    build targets :-) ).
  * Set urgency=high to hopefully get this bugfix release into sarge.

moin (1.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release. Closes: Bug#265376, #263564 (thanks to Douglas F.
    Calvert <dfc@anize.org> and Kai Weber <kai.weber@glorybox.de>):
    + fixed NameError "UnpicklingError" in user.py
    + Security-related bugfix: reverts done by bots or leechers...
      There was a bad, old bug that triggered if you did not use ACLs. In that
      case, moin used some simple (but wrong and incomplete) function to
      determine what a user (or bot) may do or may not do. The function is now
      fixed to allow only read and write to anon users, and only delete and
      revert to known users additionally - and disallow everything else.
    + avoid creation of unneccessary pages/* directories
    + removed double content divs in general info and history info pages
    + fixed wiki xmlrpc getPageHTML
    + fixed rightsidebar logout URL, also fixed top banner to link to FrontPage
    + use config.page_front_page and .page_title_index for robots meta tag
      (whether it uses index,follow or index,nofollow), not hardcoded english
      page names
    + ACL security fix for PageEditor, thanks to Dr. Pleger for reporting
    + default options for new users are same as for anon users
    + do not show excluded actions at bottom of page
    + i18n updated: ja, de, zh
    + editor: removed the columns size setting, just using 100% of browser
      window width (it didn't work because of that anyway). Also removed that
      "reduce editor size" link at top of editor as you would lose your
      changes when using it.
  * Remember to strip twikidraw.jar from source tarball.
  * Set urgency=high due to the above security-related bugfixes, and due
    to twikidraw.jar erronously provided with the earlier release.
  * Drop patch included upstream: 11_UnpicklingError.diff.
  * Drop cleaning debian/dh-buildinfo (never created - must've been from
    a manual test run).
  * Added danish localisation for newly added reject string.
  * Added note in README.Debian about the need for CGI support. Closes:
    Bug#260861 (thanks to  <nachtigall@web.de>, although not using the
    provided diff).
  * Udate watch file:
    + Use generic sourceforge "prdownload" host, which seems to be the
      only option currently - although working only for checking, not
      for automated downloads.
    + Add comment about usage of the file.
    + Add comment about brokenness of sourceforge URL.
    + Make URL as generic as possible.
  * Update TODO (add note on *.py optimizing below /usr/share/moin).

moin (1.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: Bug#254756 (thanks to Ben

    + Users now _must_ specify a password when creating a new account.
    + User accounts matching config.page_group_regex are now illegal.
      Note: existing accounts must be manually checked (read upstream
      changelog for more info).
    + subscription email sending now honours ACLs correctly.
    + Several markup / rendering / user interface fixes/improvements.
    + RSS fixes: non-ASCII characters; UTC timestamps; RecentChanges ok.

    <synrg@nslug.ns.ca>).
  * Drop hashbang patches: fixed upstream now.

    + Add newline when changing hashbang (bug in perl 5.6?).
    + Include difflib from python 2.2.3.
  * Update InterWiki.txt.
  * Small but important fix to danish localisation:
    s/BrugerIndstillinger/BrugerProfil/g .
  * Standards-version 3.6.1 (no changes needed).

    + fixed setup.py running from CVS workdir
    + fixed crash when doing action=info on first revision of a page

      names when you click on some of them)
    + fixed python colorizer processor
    + fixed quoting of stats cache filenames
    + catched "bad marshal data" error when switching python versions
    + updated danish, japanese, serbian and chinese i18n, and
      maintainance scripts now included with source (closes: Bug#220913)

  * Include as separate file the patch to enable farm_config by default.
  * Remove debian/buildinfo in clean target.

  * Improved python version handling in debian/rules:
    + Current python version hardcoded only once (to ease upgrading to
      next major release)
    + Patch hashbang of all scripts to use unversioned python (closes:
      bug#236254)
    + Check in clean target that no new versioned python scripts slips
      through
    + Support explicit using python2.2 (needed for backport to woody)
      simply by setting "DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=python22" at build time.
    + Tighten build-dependency on cdbs to support the above
  * Add note to debian/copyright about java applet stripped from source.
  * Unfuzz patches, and update 11_danish_l10n_updates (all earlier
    changes adopted upstream, minor new corrections added).
  * Replace patch 06_wikipedia_url_update with a larger and more general
    06_interwiki_update (matching update done upstream on MoinMaster).
  * Minor tweaks to farm_config.py.

moin (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: Bug#229759.
    + Support for persistent environments twisted-web, standalone,
      mod_python and FastCGI (none of them tested with Debian) in
      addition to plain CGI.
    + Caching of rendered pages.
    + Improved, internal diff handling.
    + Support for http basic auth.
    + Configurable timezone offset.
    + Configurable cookie lifetime.
    + Theme support.
    + Improved logfile access. Closes: Bug#224218.
    + Support for automatic page refreshing.
    + Improved UserPreferences layout (most options suppressed until
      user has logged in).
    + Support for dictionary definitions.
    + Improved UTF8 support (but still ISO-8859-1 by default).
    + Improved "wiki groups" handling.
    + Mostly HTML 4.01 Strict compliant HTML, and use of CSS for visual
      markup.
    + Updated (and further improved to handle imagemaps) TWikiDrawPlugin
      (not included with this Debian package).
    + Fixed email headers and encoding.
  * Updated debian/copyright:
    + Drop info included in debian/changelog
    + Update copyright and licensing info (only cosmetic changes, and
      years covered updated)
  * Add NEWS.Debian suggesting to read HelpOnUpdating for needed local
    updates.
  * Update patches.
    + Unfuzz.

    + New danish l18n update.
  * Remove obsolete (and temporarily disabled) simplified login patch.
  * Tighten access rights to 0750/0640 (giving world read access doesn't
    make sense with ACLs - as pointed out in upstream comment). Also, no
    longer "shout" at upstream default (no longer world write, only
    group write - which is still unnecessary in most situations).
  * Ignore PNG files in compile time access rights check.
  * Update farm_config.py and sample config.py to match upstream
    changes.
  * Enable farm_config by default.
  * Avoid installing as Debian native package.

  * Change suggestion to python2.3-4suite (not in Debian yet, but
    hopefully one day...).

    has changed userform design).
  * Add symlink from /usr/share/dict/words to
    /usr/share/moin/data/dict/words.
  * Add new /etc/moin/farm_config.py, and update example moin_config.py
    to use it.
  * Correct make target so dh_buildinfo is actually used (closes:
    Bug#211416).
  * The scripts in site-packages are not meant to be executed, so strip
    hashbang altogether (closes: Bug#206395). The actual scripts are
    provided at /usr/share/doc/moin/examples, because they need tweaking
    to include local config of each installed wiki (closes: Bug#210451).

    + list items set apart by empty lines are now also set apart
      visually (by adding the CSS class "gap" to <li>)

      button to add more than one category)
    + `MailTo` macro for adding spam-safe email links to a page
    + added "revert" link to PageInfo view (which makes DeletePage more

      use SMTP AUTH
    + replaced `config.page_template_ending` by a more flexible setting
      named `config.page_template_regex`
    + `config.edit_locking` can be set to None (old behaviour, no
      locking), 'warn <timeout mins>' (warn about concurrent edits, but

    + Selection for logged in users (i.e. no bots) to extend the listing

    + "save" check for security.Permissions

    Unfinished or experimental features:
    + SystemAdmin macro
  * Remove Debian-specific danish pages (they where all adopted
    upstream).
  * Roll back danish translation a few days to avoid newest unwanted
    changes.
  * Urgency medium because of the security issues.
  * Update to latest version of CBS (Colin's Build System).
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 3.5.9 (no changes needed).

  * Update patches.
    + Fix yet another bad permission setting.

  * New CVS snapshot.
    + config.title1, config.title2, config.page_footer1,
      config.page_footer2 can now be callables and will be called with
      the "request" object as a single argument (note that you should
      accept any keyword arguments in order to be compatible to future

  * New CVS Snapshot (nothing changed, actually, but needed a new source
    for the next item...).

    default).
