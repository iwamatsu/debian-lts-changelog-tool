    - Reverts to the vanilla mutt keybindings. (Closes: #834448, #834500)
    - Hide the progress bar if it wasn't given a color. (Closes: #834450)
    - Drop neomutt-devel/*sidebar* patches, already included upstream.

    - Some patches, including sensible-browser, refreshed.
    - Slightly modified the AC_INIT in configure.ac so that the package builds.

mutt (1.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New NeoMutt release, 2016-08-08.
    - Fixes crash when closing compressed mbox files. (Closes: #834024)
    - Drop patch features/809802_timeout_hook.patch, merged upstream.
    - Drop patch debian/patches/features/multiple-fcc.patch, merged upstream.
    - Drop patch imap-sidebar-update-bug.patch, was an upstream backport.
    - Refresh patch neomutt-devel/sensible-browser.patch.
  * Backport three sidebar fixes, courtesy of upstream vanilla mutt maintainer
    Kevin J. McCarthy.
  * Add a patch to avoid a warning message if getrandom() fails. This should
    help not scare off users that are running a jessie kernel, among others.
    Thanks to Adam Borowski for the fix. (Closes: #833593)

mutt (1.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * New upstream NeoMutt release, 2016-07-23.
    - Adds SMIME encrypt to self patch. (Closes: #688970)
  * Backport a fix for the sidebar from neomutt git/mutt hg, patch
    imap-sidebar-update-bug.patch.
  * Update NEWS.Debian and (unfortunately) rewrite history in order to make it
    a little more consistent and easier to read for users upgrading from
    jessie. (Closes: #832761)
  * The sidebar patch has been stabilized with this release, with the option
    names also having been stable enough to be included into upstream mutt
    (what will become 1.7.0). All the known Debian bugs have been fixed and
    changes have been documented in NEWS. (Closes: #499596, #741853, #777127,
    #821748, #823142, #823454, #823654, #823655)
  * Remove the /etc/Muttrc.d/sidebar.rc conffile which enabled sidebar by
    default. Sidebar is now OFF by default, in order to stick with upstream's
    defaults and what most mutt users expect. Document this in NEWS.Debian.
  * Ship our patched Muttrc instead of the stock, non-generated Muttrc,
    a regression from 1.6.1-2. (Closes: #830692, #830695)
  * Remove the assumed_charset-compat.patch and inform users of the renamed
    option ("file_charset" -> "attach_charset") via NEWS.Debian.

mutt (1.6.1-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Fold mutt-patched into mutt, as the line between the wo has became more
    blurry since its introduction. Upstream mutt has merged the sidebar and
    the Debian mutt binary package already carries a lot of feature patches.
    - Remove the mutt-patched binary from debian/control.
    - Add Breaks/Replaces: mutt-patched on the mutt binary package.
    - Remove mutt-patched rules from debian/rules.
    - Move multiple-fcc (the only remaining patch) under features/.
  * Similarly, fold mutt-kz, a binary from a different source package until
    now, into mutt. mutt-kz upstream has joined forces with NeoMutt, so this
    is now a matter of just passing --enable-notmuch to our ./configure.
  * Remove update-alternatives support for /usr/bin/mutt and associated
    manpages and docs. This only existed for the benefit of mutt-patched and
    mutt-kz and is thus moot now.
  * Update neomutt to a newer version, 20160611.
    - Enable *all* the neomutt patches now, not just a hand-picked selection.
    - Use the single patch, as the broken out patches conflict with each
      other.
    - Drop the compressed-folders, NNTP and path_max patches, as they are now
      part of neomutt.
    - Update sensible-browser and multiple-fcc patches to adjusted versions
      from the neomutt-upstream.
    - Adjust the package's description to mention some of neomutt's features.
  * Enable all hardening build flags. (Closes: #823295)
  * Remove README.Patches from /usr/share/doc. Including a unified diff in
    /usr/share/doc isn't very useful; the source package can always be used
    instead.
  * Remove mentions of gpg-2comp from gpg.rc and README.Debian and ship the
    resulting gpg.rc into /etc/Muttrc.d pristine, with the comments included.
  * Switch to tokyocabinet (from qdbm) in hurd-i386 as well, as it is nowadays
    available there too.
  * Lower Priority to optional (from standard), as this is currently the value
    in the archive, as overridden by ftp-masters.
  * Remove postinst code that handles migrations from pre-1.5.20-9 versions,
    as it's too old (even wheezy shipped with 1.5.21-6.2).
  * Remove preinst code that handles an obsolete conffile from pre-1.5.19-2
    versions, for the same reasons.
  * Remove Conflicts/Replaces mutt-utf8, it was last shipped with version
    1.5.5.1-20040105+1, released over 12 years ago.
  * Remove statically-linked-binary lintian override for mutt_dotlock, not the
    case anymore.
  * Remove quilt.mk and manual quilt invocations. Rely on the native 3.0
    (quilt) source package format instead for applying debian/patches.
  * Use dh_bugfiles instead of manual install invocations.
  * Migrate from our own -dbg package to the automatic -dbgsym package.
  * Migrate to dh, instead of our hand-crafted old-style debhelper d/rules.
  * Migrate to dh-autoreconf instead of autotools-dev.
  * Revamp debian/copyright: use copyright-format 1.0 (aka DEP5), update the
    list of copyright holders, add a debian/* stanza with all the past
    maintainers for the period they were maintainers etc.
  * Change Maintainer to the newly created pkg-mutt-maintainers list.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

mutt (1.6.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.

  [ Sebastian Ramacher ]
  * Update link to sidebar documentation and update the sample (Closes: #822729)

  [ James McCoy ]
  * fix compilation of nntp.patch and re-enable it again (Closes: #822893)

  [ Evgeni Golov ]
  * document sidebar changes via debian/NEWS (Closes: #822910)

  [ Matteo F. Vescovi ]
  * Imported Upstream version 1.6.1
  * debian/README.source: file dropped

  [ Faidon Liambotis ]
  * Remove patch define-pgp_getkeys_command.
    According to the upstream bug report, it was never supposed to work like
    our patch (adding a commented-out setting) expected it to.
  * Import neomutt 20160502 under debian/patches/neomutt.
    To be used soon.
  * Replace ifdef.patch with neomutt's
  * Replace the three trash patches with neomutt's
    - features/imap_fast_trash.patch
    - features/purge-message.patch
    - features/trash-folder.patch
  * Replace our sidebar patches with neomutt's.
    This replaces all 4 of our sidebar patches (and more!). Unfortunately,
    needed a tiny fix over neomutt's sidebar because of our opposite
    ordering vis-a-vis 11-ifdef.
  * Remove the sidebar.muttrc sample, new patch has proper docs
  * Update NEWS with the new (NeoMutt's) sidebar changes
  * Replace NNTP patch with neomutt's
  * Replace sensible-browser patch with neomutt's
  * Manually resolve some patch fuzz
  * Restore PATCHES before quilt push/pops.
    Our new neomutt patches modify PATCHES, which results in conflicts with
    our debian/rules code that also modifies it. Back PATCHES up and restore
    it before any quilt operations.

mutt (1.5.11+cvs20060126-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to CVS 2006-01-26; since this includes a huge diff between
    ChangeLog and ChangeLog.old (moved entries), prepare a new tarball.
    Some worth-mentioning changes:

    + Mutt can now expand its own variables as it does with envvars; for
      example, it's now possible to put something like this into a hook:
      set sendmail="mysmtp -f $from".

    + Support for user-defined variables starting with my_; environment
      variables take precedence, and expansion does not occur in shell-escape.

    + Pattern group support, as explained (only!) in:
        <http://does-not-exist.org/mail-archives/mutt-dev/msg05693.html>

    + Loooots of improvments in the IMAP code, including sync speed-ups
      (through pipelining), hcache stuff (eg. $imap_cachedir), and things
      like $imap_idle and support for the "old" flag in IMAP folders.

  * Rework the package build system to fit personal preference:
    + debhelperize debian/rules a bit more.
    + drop dbs in favor of quilt; reorganize patches a bit.

      (NOTE: quilt means that dropping patches into debian/patches is
      no longer enough to get them applied; they must be listed in the
      debian/patches/series file.)

  * Adjustments to debian/control:
    + use '*' for the bulleted list, instead of 'o'.
    + build-depend on gawk instead of mawk, to have "nextfile".
    + drop conflicts and replaces on packages that are not in woody.

  * Updated debian/copyright.

  * Added debian/watch.

    + does not fail to open messages that contain base64-encoded inline PGP
      bits (signature, encrypted hunk, or a key). (Closes: #340116)

      Also, do not report success to decrypt an inline PGP message when
      decryption actually failed.

  * Again, update my e-mail address in debian/control, yada yada.

mutt (1.5.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to CVS 2005-11-01, with the following worth-of-mentioning goodies
    (among others):

    + full read/write >2 GB mbox support.
    + attachment counting patch merged upstream (%X in index_format); check
      the "Attachment Searching and Counting" section in the manual for more
      information.

    And the following bugs are fixed as well:

    + S/MIME keys can be selected from the menu.  (Closes: #318470)
    + clarified description of pop_checkinterval. (Closes: #320642)

  * Update my e-mail address in debian/control.

mutt (1.5.11-2) unstable; urgency=low (but fixes critical bug not in testing)

  * The fix for coping with mboxes bigger than 2 GB introduced a bug affecting
    at least powerpc (but not i386) which made mutt write Content-Length: 0 in
    mboxes due to a un-updated %ld format specifier. This caused for mail to
    be lost in the next mbox write.

    Apply a patch quickly provided by upstream (thanks, Brendan Cully!) that
    makes mutt use the right format specifier. (Closes: #330474)

  * Update the compressed folders to the 1.5.11, which includes documentation
    in XML format.

 -- Adeodato Simó <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Fri, 30 Sep 2005 01:15:28 +0200

mutt (1.5.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, fixing the following bugs:

    + ~h can match folded headers. (Closes: #319654)
    + implements progress indication when uploading messages to an imap
      folder. (Closes: #228713)
    + limit pattern is properly displayed when zero messages matched.
      (Closes: #242398)

    A further CVS pull (2005-09-24) fixes the following bugs:

    + can open mboxes bigger than 2 GB. (Closes: #296940)
    + does not require GPG_TTY to be set in order to accept using the GnuPG
      agent: it'll set the variable itself if not present. (Closes: #316388)
    + does not segfault when replying to a message if content_type is unset.
      (Closes: #329306)
    + does not segfault with IMAP folder completion. (Closes: #329442)

    Packaging changes needed:

    + Upstream documentation now comes in XML, so changed Build-Dependency on
      linuxdoc-tools-text and groff to xsltproc, docbook-xml, docbook-xsl and
      links. Added patch debian/patches/doc_build_adjustments.diff to force
      the use of links instead of lynx for generating the text version of the
      manual, and to not ignore errors from links and xsltproc.

    + Changed --with-sasl2 to its new name --with-sasl in debian/rules;
      removed extra hunk on debian/patches/patch-1.5.4.Md.sasl2-1arc.

    + Rediffed 080_Md.Muttrc, removed patch.asp.fix-bug-266493.1 (applied
      upstream).

    + Temporarily removed documentation from the compressed-folders patch,
      until upstream reacts to the move to XML.

  * Build against libgnutls12 (build-depend on libgnutls-dev instead of
    libgnutls11-dev). (Closes: #323279)

  * Remove spurious dash in argument to -encrypt in smime_encrypt_command.
    (Closes: #315319)

mutt (1.5.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, fixing the following bugs:
    + does not store gpg passphrase when signing or decrypting has failed,
      since that probably means it was wrong. (Closes: #132548)
    + does not fail to delete attachments in unencrypted mails. (Closes:
      #302500)

  * New functionality overview or otherwise noticeable news:
    + $imap_check_subscribed variable to add the list of subscribed folders to
      the buffy list.
    + $braille_friendly variable to make Mutt more usable for blind users.
    + $imap_login variable in case the login name on the IMAP server is
      different to the name of the account ($imap_user).
    + -D command line option to dump current configuration, after all
      initialization files have been read.
    + $imap_force_ssl gone.
    + an empty limit is now interpreted as a request to cancel the current
      limit.

  * Patches:
    + 080_Md.paths_mutt.man: adjusted; upstream build system puts now the
      right paths in mutt.1 using @bindir@. Install mutt.1 instead of mutt.man
      in debian/rules.
    + 080_Md.Muttrc: don't set menu_move_off in /etc/Muttrc since the
      compile-time default is now what we want (pre-1.5.7 compatible).
    + edit-threads, current-shortcut, incomplete-mbyte: removed, integrated
      upstream.
    + maildir-mtime: s/if/ifdef/ to get it to apply.
    + compressed-folders: updated to 1.5.10.

  * Upstream now builds "complete" documentation, i.e., for all features
    whether enabled or not. Disable that for Debian. [patch.docs-match-config.h]

  * Build-Depend on autotools-dev and use updated config.{guess,sub} at build
    time to fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD. (Closes: #302735)

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.6.2 (no changes required).

  * Set myself as the maintainer, and remove Marco from Uploaders as agreed
    with him.

  * Don't set pipe_default in debian/patches/080_Md.Muttrc, and stick to
    upstream's default (unset). (Closes: #300830)

  * Updated the compressed folders patch to version 1.5.9.

  * Updated patch 080_Md.Muttrc to restore the old behaviour of the index.

mutt (1.5.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, with a CVS pull to get all the translation updates
    that happen right after a release. New features worth mentioning:
    + the PGP auto decode patch by Derek Martin has been accepted upstream,
      so inline PGP messages are automatically verified/decrypted now if
      $pgp_auto_decode is set. (Closes: #269699)
    + IDN decoding can be disabled by unseting $use_idn (set by default).
    + new hook 'send2-hook', which gets executed each time there is a change
      in a message being composed. This permits, for example, to match against
      recipients added manually after writing the mail, which wasn't possible
      with 'send-hook' alone.
    + Christoph Berg's menu_context patch is also included. Check the
      $menu_context and $menu_move_off variables.

  * This version also includes the following fixes:
    + message flags are not lost after editing a message. (Closes: #275060)
    + IMAP folder paths ending with the delimiter are trimmed so that they
      don't fail to open with some servers, e.g. Courier. (Closes: #277665)
    + the correct charset is used when signing a forwarded message.
      (Closes: #295528)
    + correctly forget the S/MIME passphrase. (Closes: #300516)

  * Explicitly pass --enable-inodesort to ./configure, since upstream has
    disabled it by default in this version.

  * Updated the compressed folders patch to version 1.5.8.

  * Dropped the adjust_line and adjust_edited_file patches from
    extra-patches/mutt-ja-compat, incorporated upstream. Renamed
    mutt-ja-compat to assumed-charset, since that's the only patch that
    remains.

  * Lots of patches in the Debian package have been applied upstream, drop
    them (16 in total). Worth mentioning is the gnutls patch. The
    maildir_inode_sort patch has been adopted too, with the static functions
    no longer being nested, which closes: #287744 (FTBFS with gcc-4.0).

  * Implemented a conf.d style directory for mutt: other packages or local
    admins may now drop configuration snippets in /etc/Muttrc.d/*.rc and have
    them sourced at the end of the default Muttrc. (Closes: #285574)

  * Updated the header cache patch to version 28. The size of this patch has
    been drastically reduced, since the generic code and the IMAP support has
    been incorporated upstream.

  * Updated the compressed folders patch to version 1.5.8.

  * Use mixmaster-filter by default. (Closes: #299060)

mutt (1.5.6-20040907+3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Upload targeted at sarge to include some must-have fixes.

  * Include small patch to fix imap-related segfaults in ia64, due to a buffer
    length being declared as int instead of size_t in the gnutls patch. Thanks
    to David Mosberger for spotting the problem. (Closes: #234783, #285001)
    [New file: upstream/extra-patches/gnutls.59.size_t-fix]

  * Include (finally!) a patch that really prevents decrypt-save from deleting
    the message if the supplied password was wrong. (Closes: #275188)
    [New file: upstream/patches/decrypt-save_non-empty-output]

  * Updated the header-cache patch to version 25, which includes a fix to make
    it possible for hcache to talk to broken Lotus IMAP servers. (Closes: #282451)
    [Modified file: upstream/extra-patches/header-cache]

  * The mutt BTS has been closed due to excessive spam in their debbugs
    installation. Included the patch that substitutes flea and flea.1 by a
    note that states so.
    [New file: upstream/patches/empty-muttbug,
     removed file: debian/patches/080_Md.muttbug]

  * Removed /usr/share/bug/mutt/presubj, now useless.

  * Added Domainkey-Signature to the list of ignored headers.
    [Modified file: debian/patches/080_Md.Muttrc]

mutt (1.5.6-20040907+2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * A "Let's procrastinate some important stuff and fix a bunch of mutt bugs
    instead" release.

  * Include small patch to fix the Swedish translation, which was making
    impossible to turn off pgp signing and/or encrypting. (Closes: #281265)
    [New file: upstream/patches/i18n-sv-fix.diff]

  * Make the default Muttrc work out the box for people using gnupg-agent.
    Wrote and applied a one-line patch to make the %?p? conditional escape
    work correctly, patch forwarded upstream. (Closes: #277646)
    [New file: debian/patches/patch.asp.%p-escape-agent-compatible.1]

  * Relocate the definition of the USE_GNUTLS macro, so that it gets passed to
    the documentation build process too. Otherwise, options that end up in the
    manual wouldn't match those that are really compiled in. (Closes: #278124)
    [Modified files: debian/rules, upstream/extra-patches/gnutls.debian]

  * Honour /etc/alternatives/pager in the muttbug script. (Closes: #275448)
    [Modified file: debian/patches/080_Md.muttbug]

  * Include patch by Nicolas François <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net> to
    fix typo in muttrc.5. (Closes: #272579)
    [New file: debian/patches/patch.nf.fix-bug-272579.1]

  * Updated the (formerly unmaintained) current-shortcut patch with a new
    version by Christoph Berg <cb@df7cb.de>. Now the actual used Fcc will be
    shown instead of '^' when you folder-hook . 'set record="^"'.
    [Modified file: upstream/extra-patches/current-shortcut]

  * Updated the header-cache patch to version 24.

mutt (1.5.6-20040907+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to CVS snapshot 20040907 (includes updated ja translation).

  * The maildir-mtime patch is now NOT enabled by default, you need to set the
    maildir_mtime variable in your ~/.muttrc. This variable has been necessary
    since people with large maildirs over NFS experienced a large performance
    impact with the mtime patch enabled. (Closes: #253261)

  * Updated the header cache patch to version 21. This fixes a file descriptor
    leak which could cause problems for people who keep their mutt open for a
    long time. Also includes support for per-folder cache: setting $header_cache
    to a directory will enable it, and you should experience some performance
    gains.

  * Included the current shortcut patch. It's completely unintrusive and
    allows you to specify ^ as a shortcut for the current folder (e.g., in a
    Fcc). (Closes: #253104)

  * Updated the autotools stuff. Include in it also stuff from patches, so
    that --enable-foo options can be used in debian/rules. Put files directly
    in extra/autotools and cp from there in debian/rules instead of using a
    patch file (which was too big due to automake1.4/autoconf2.13 => 1.8/2.50
    migration).

  * debian/rules:
    + use --enable-compresed --enable-hcache --without-gdbm in configure.
    + copy autotools files from extra/autotools when unpacking, and emulate
      the 000_Md.config.h.in patch.

  * debian/patches/:
    + removed 000_Md.config.h.in, no longer needed since config.h.in is now
      overwritten from extra/autotools.
    + added patch.asp.fix-bug-266493.1, which makes mutt not wait for a
      keypress to handle SIGWINCH in certain situations. (Closes: #123943,
      #266493)

mutt (1.5.6-20040818+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The post-Sarge era officially begins for mutt. This mostly means
    that patch inclusion policy will untighten a bit.

  * Added the maildir/imap header caching patch by Thomas Glanzmann, see:
    <http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~sithglan/mutt>. For a quick
    start, read documentation for the $header_cache variable.
    (Closes: #242762, #255475)

  * Added the maildir-mtime patch by Dale Woolridge, see
    <http://www.mutt.ca/maildir-mtime.html>. This patch should make happy
    users that use maildir and have $sort_browser=reverse-date.
    (Closes: #253261)

  * Reorganized patches location:
    + patches not written by the mutt maintainers are now in the
      upstream/extra-patches directory.
    + each patch in that directory now contains a preamble listing:
      - the patch author
      - the patch home page
      - last time patch was updated
      - exact URL to the patch file
      - applied changes, if any
    + all preambles are available in the doc/README.Patches file, and
      debian/copyright now points to this file too.

  * Other changes in upstream/extra-patches/:
    + updated the edit-threads patch.
    + updated the compressed-folders patch.

  * Updated to CVS snapshot 20040818:
    + various memory leaks spotted and fixed.
    + several translations updated: pl, sv, fr, id, nl, de, ca, cs.
      The Czech translation addresses a bad chosen shorcut in the crypt menu,
      and thus closes: #140639. Updated German translation closes: #265120.
    + fix some UI flaws in the new PGP and S/MIME menus which could easily
      make the user send in clear mail which was meant to be signed and/or
      encrypted (the (e)ncrypt, (s)ign and (b)oth commands were toggles).
      Also renamed the (f)orget action to (c)lear for newbie's benefit; accept
      the (f) key for long time users' benefit.
    + make mutt not hang if STARTTLS fails to complete the SSL handshake.
    + try all methods in $imap_authenticators when one of them fails;
      previously mutt would give up upon the first of them failing.

  * debian/:
    + scripts/vars: add upstream/extra-patches to SRC_PATCH_DIR.
    + control: Build-Depend on libdb4.2-dev for the header-cache patch.
    + rules: call scripts/patch-preamble to create the README.Patches file.
    + copyright: add pointer to README.Patches, where patch authors are listed.

  * debian/patches/:
    + updated 000_VERSION to reflect new snapshot date.
    + removed obsolete #defines from 000_Md.config.h.in. Added #include
      "debian-config.h" there, which is used by upstream/extra-patches/*.debian.
    + removed patch.asp.fix-bug-260578.1, included upstream.

  * debian/rules: sort the PATCHES file, which is printed by `mutt -v`.

  * Updated to CVS snapshot 20040722:
    + bugfixes:
      - does not segfault when chdir'ing to a directory without read
        permission. (Closes: #237426)
      - does not segfault when applying check-traditional-pgp to multiple
        messages. (Closes: #257277)
      - uses the right From address when composing a new message from the
        pager and $reverse_name is set. (Closes: #249870)
      - initial IMAP header download does not take quadratic time on the
        number of messages. (Closes: #213412)
    + new functionality:
      - support for spam-scoring filters (see §3.24 of the fine manual).
      - $include_onlyfirst: controls whether or not Mutt includes only the
        first attachment of the message you are replying.
      - $hide_thread_subject: when unset, mutt will show the subject for all
        messages in a thread.
      - uses List-Post header when doing list-reply. (Initial RFC 2369 support,
        closes: #49048)
  * debian/patches/:
    + updated 000_VERSION to reflect new snapshot date.
    + updated the following patches to apply cleanly:

      - patch-1.5.3.cd.edit_threads.9.2-1arc [mutt.h]
    + updated patch-1.5.6.tt.compat.1 (does not close #259145).
    + removed patch-1.5.3.Md.gpg-agent, issue fixed upstream.
    + added patch-1.5.6.helmersson.incomplete-mbyte.2 by Anders Helmersson
      to avoid passing incomplete multibyte sequences to regexec(), which can
      cause segfaults due to libc6 Bug#261135. (Closes: #254314, #260623)
      [Yes, this is a sequel, not a dejà-vu.]
    + added patch.asp.fix-bug-{210679,254294,258621,260578}.1, which fix
      several minor issues unaddressed by upstream for some time. All patches
      submitted upstream. (Closes: #210679, #254294, #258621, #260578). 
  * debian/rules:
    + be robust to any locale by exporting LC_ALL=C. (Closes: #253048)
    + touch some autotools files to prevent having them to be built again.
  * Using "urgency=high" at maintainer's discretion

  * Updated to CVS snapshot 20040523:
    + now mutt includes better support for inline/traditional signing and
      encrypting. See http://www.woolridge.ca/mutt/pgp-menu-traditional.html
      for details. (Closes: #190204)
    + sourcing output of a command works again. (Closes: #247007)
    + corrected .PP usage in flea.1 and mbox.5. (Closes: #237827)
    + do not eat chars on rfc822-valid From:address lines (i.e., when there

    + 080_Md.Muttrc: make colors respect terminal scheme. (Closes: #86393)
