libpgjava (42.2.5-2+deb10u4) buster-security; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS team.
  * Fix CVE-2024-1597:
    A possible SQL injection vulnerability was found in libpgjava, the
    PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. It allows an attacker to inject SQL if using
    PreferQueryMode=SIMPLE which is not the default mode. In the default mode
    there is no vulnerability.

      with -Djdbc2=true or -Djdbc3=true arguments during build
    - Patched to allow explicit selection of SSL usage during
      compile time with -Dssl=true (JDBC2 build has to be built without SSL)

      -Dtarget=1.3 for JDBC2 and -Dtarget=1.4 for JDBC3
