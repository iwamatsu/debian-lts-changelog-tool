netty (1:4.1.33-1+deb10u5) buster-security; urgency=high

  * Team upload.
  * Julien Viet discovered that Netty, a Java NIO client/server socket
    framework, was vulnerable to allocation of resources without limits or
    throttling due to the accumulation of data in the HttpPostRequestDecoder.
    This would allow an attacker to cause a denial of service.

  * Fix CVE-2023-44487:
    The HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource
    consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly.
  * Fix a FTBFS with newer OpenJDK versions.

    smuggling vulnerabilities have been discovered in Netty which may allow
    attackers to cause a denial of service or bypass restrictions when used as
    a proxy.

netty (1:4.1.33-1+deb10u2) buster-security; urgency=high

  * Team upload.
  * Fix the following security vulnerabilites:
    - CVE-2019-20444:
      HttpObjectDecoder.java allows an HTTP header that lacks a colon, which
      might be interpreted as a separate header with an incorrect syntax, or
      might be interpreted as an "invalid fold."
    - CVE-2019-20445:
      HttpObjectDecoder.java allows a Content-Length header to be accompanied
      by a second Content-Length header, or by a Transfer-Encoding header.
    - CVE-2020-7238:
      Netty allows HTTP Request Smuggling because it mishandles
      Transfer-Encoding whitespace (such as a [space]Transfer-Encoding:chunked
      line) and a later Content-Length header.
    - CVE-2020-11612:
      The ZlibDecoders allow for unbounded memory allocation while decoding a
      ZlibEncoded byte stream. An attacker could send a large ZlibEncoded byte
      stream to the Netty server, forcing the server to allocate all of its
      free memory to a single decoder.
    - CVE-2021-21290:
      In Netty there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an
      insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local
      information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory
      if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like
      systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such,
      writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the
      file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure.
    - CVE-2021-21295:
      In Netty there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. If a
      Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP/2 request, the
      field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up.
      This is fine as long as the request is not proxied through as HTTP/1.1.
      If the request comes in as an HTTP/2 stream, gets converted into the
      HTTP/1.1 domain objects (`HttpRequest`, `HttpContent`, etc.) via
      `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec `and then sent up to the child
      channel's pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as HTTP/1.1 this may
      result in request smuggling.
    - CVE-2021-21409:
      In Netty there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. The
      content-length header is not correctly validated if the request only uses
      a single Http2HeaderFrame with the endStream set to to true. This could
      lead to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote peer and
      translated to HTTP/1.1.
