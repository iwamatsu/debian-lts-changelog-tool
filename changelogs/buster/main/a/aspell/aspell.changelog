aspell (0.60.7~20110707-1.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Implement multiarch (Closes: #667592), (LP:#1324525, LP:#960160).
    This is only a partial multiarch implementation, where aspell hashes
    can be shared between 32/64 bit architectures with the same endianness
    (but not with different endiannesses) by always using 32bit numbers.
  * Some independent changes needed for multiarch:
    - 08_filters-info-installdir.diff: Make sure all filters related stuff
      is installed together. This should make possible to have different
      values for "pkgdatadir" and "pkglibdir" selections, thus really
      fixing (Closes: #612051).
    - Force aspell hash function to use a 32-bit integer to allow
      hashes being shared between 32 and 64 bit architectures. Note that
      they cannot be shared between systems with different endianness.
    - Modify to use "/usr/share/aspell" for arch indep stuff, except
      filters and dict description files. Change aspell compat level.
    - 09_debian-dictdir.diff: Implement a new debian specific
      "--debian-dict-dir" configure option to allow explicitly setting an
      independent path for dictionaries.
    - debian/rules: Make sure original Changelog.html is installed. It
      gets rebuilt later and may lead to problems with multiarch if
      different makeinfo versions are used in different architectures.
  * debian/control: Canonicalize Vcs-* headers.

aspell (0.60.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the debian-changes-0.60.6-5 patch which was accidentally
    introduced.
  * Reverted the pkgdatadir change since it breaks filters.  The spell and
    ispell scripts will just be left in /usr/lib/aspell, which is a
    retarded place for them but, eh, it's just not worth fighting the
    aspell build system over it.  (Closes: #612051)

  * debian/rules: changed pkgdatadir to /usr/share/aspell which is a more
    appropriate location for that data than /usr/lib/aspell, and leave the
    spell and ispell scripts there so that run-with-aspell works

aspell (0.60.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * manual/aspell.1: removed a stray ')' character
  * debian/control: renamed libaspell15c2 back to libaspell15, and
    replaced libaspell15c2 with a dummy package depending upon
    libaspell15.  This effectively undoes the GCC 4.0 transition.
    libaspell, like libGLU, is written in C++ but only publicly exports a
    C interface so the transition is not necessary.
    (Closes: #317873, #318187)
  * debian/control: made libaspell15 conflict with earlier versions of
    aspell-bin, since /usr/bin/aspell uses C++ linkage to libaspell and
    thus cannot be used with the libaspell15 built with GCC 4.0.
  * Don't install the spell and ispell compatibility scripts in
    /usr/lib/aspell.  Instead install them in
    /usr/share/doc/aspell/examples so that they're easier to find.
    (Closes: #273761)
  * Added support for using dpatch.
  * Created an autotools build system dpatch that contains updated gettext
    macros, which should fix build failures on some arches.
    (Closes: #316666)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jul 2005 16:13:03 -0700

aspell (0.60.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release to fully support autobuilding dictionary hashes
  * Install a /usr/share/aspell/aspell.compat file containing a
    compatibility string used by aspell-autobuildhash from
    dictionaries-common
  * debian/aspell.postinst: run aspell-autobuildhash if the binary is
    available
  * debian/control: add a dependency on dictionaries-common (>> 0.40)
  * debian/control: no longer conflict with "aspell-dictionary", but
    instead add it to the |'d list of supported virtual dictionary
    packages.  Pre-sarge, the aspell-dictionary package was used for
    dictionaries supporting aspell 0.50.x and earlier.  Post-sarge, it
    will represent dictionaries with autobuilt hash files.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Jul 2005 07:47:03 -0700

aspell (0.60.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: renamed libaspell15 to libaspell15c2 for the GCC 4.0
    ABI change transition
  * debian/control: dropped a ton of old cruft in the conflicts/replaces
    lines
  * debian/rules: pass configure flags to change pkglibdir and pkgdatadir
    from /usr/lib/aspell-0.60 to /usr/lib/aspell, which is needed to make
    dictionary auto-hash-building transitions to newer Aspell versions
    less painful.  Note that this breaks all current aspell dictionary
    packages which install into /usr/lib/aspell-0.60.
  * debian/control: conflict with aspell6-dictionary packages, depend on
    aspell6a-dictionary packages instead
  * debian/control: merged aspell-bin back into aspell, since there really
    isn't any point in distinguishing between the two, especially when
    dictionary auto-hash-building becomes the norm.  It also eliminates a
    cyclical dependency on dictionaries that depend directly on aspell.
  * Added a NEWS.Debian.gz file documenting the dictionary transition
    details.

aspell (0.60.2+20050121-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: made aspell-bin depend on the Source-Version of
    libaspell15.  The /usr/bin/aspell binary uses some symbols that aren't
    exposed in the public aspell.h interface, so it requires a stricter
    version of the library than provides by shlibs. (Closes: #307481)
  * modules/speller/default/suggest.cpp: applied patch from upstream to
    fix the problem with ultra or fast not returing any suggestions with
    some languages
  * common/string.cpp: applied patch from upstream to fix a faulty sanity

aspell (0.60.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on libncursesw5-dev instead of libncurses5-dev, since
    Aspell needs the wide character support to properly display UTF-8

aspell (0.60.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - support for UTF-8 and other encodings (Closes: #131328, #170458)
    - affix compression support
    - manual converted to texinfo

    - fixes abort when --extra-dicts is used (Closes: #236823)
    - fixes infinite loop when trying to replace a word with the identical
      text (Closes: #261589)
  * debian/rules: converted to use cdbs
  * debian/control: added build-dep on cdbs
  * debian/control: removed Build-Depends-Indep because the manual no
    longer needs to be generated
  * Removed Debian-specific manpages, as these have now been included
    upstream.
  * debian/control: Depend on aspell-en | aspell6-dictionary, since the
    dictionary format has changed again.  Made libaspell15 conflict with
    aspell-dictionary, since dictionaries in that format are no longer
    usable.
  * Removed doc-base support since only the texinfo manuals are installed
    now.  Upstream still includes html documentation, though it's not
    installed in the install target, so it would be possible to resurrect
    if there's demand for it.
  * Eased the shlibs dependency tightness on libaspell15 by specifying a
    dependency of >= 0.60, instead of the full 0.60.x version.  Upstream
    uses proper versioning and won't change the API in 0.60.x releases, so
    this should be a safe setting.

aspell (0.50.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - Integrates fix introduced in 0.50.4-2

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Nov 2003 23:38:40 -0800

aspell (0.50.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from upstream to fix a bug causing Aspell to drop the
    last character in a word when saving the word to the personal
    dictionary, in some situations.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Oct 2003 18:47:04 -0700

aspell (0.50.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Complain instead of doing nothing or aborting for unimplemented
      functions in Aspell utility, especially 'aspell filter'.
      (Closes: #189759)
    - Aspell API documentation fixes (Closes: #187290)
  * Integrate upstream fixes to #185142 as well as g++ 3.3 fixes.
  * Upstream now uses newer, less broken libtool, so there's no longer a
    need to rerun the autotool chain and include it in the .diff.gz.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Oct 2003 10:11:09 -0700

aspell (0.50.3-13) unstable; urgency=low

    to /etc instead of /usr/etc.  (Closes: #194480)
  * prog/checker_string.cpp: added an #include <cassert> to fix
    a failure-to-build with g++ 3.3.

aspell (0.50.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrote the aspell.1 manpage to get in sync with upstream's user manual.
  * Corrected an erroneous example in the aspell.1 that incorrectly

    (Closes: #182077)
  * Added a copy of the FDL to reference from the aspell.1 manpage.
  * Added a debian/aspell-doc.copyright that notes the true license (FDL)

aspell (0.50.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use debian/compat instead of DH_COMPAT=n in debian/rules.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Feb 2003 22:37:07 -0800

aspell (0.50.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * libaspell15 now Conflicts/Replaces with all of the old libaspell's to
    ensure they aren't left lying around from old installations.
    (Closes: #179466)
  * Commented out the AC_DISABLE_STATIC macro in configure.ac so that the
    static library is built, as required by Policy 11.2.

    belong. (Closes: #179173)

aspell (0.50.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bumped up Build-depends to automake1.7, since this is what upstream
    uses.  Modified debian/rules accordingly.
  * Install upstream's changelog.
  * Conflict with aspell-bg (<= 2.0-2.2).
  * Moved pspell-config and its manpage to libpspell-dev.  It had
    inadvertently been moved from libpspell to aspell-bin. (Closes: #178637)
  * Improved the package descriptions.  Thanks Filip Van Raemdonck
    <mechanix@debian.org> for the suggestions. (Closes: #177528)
  * Things to note that were not mentioned in changelog for the 0.33.x to
    0.50.x release:
    - The library sonames changed, so no explicit action was necessary for
      the GCC 3.2 transition.
    - libaspell15 explicitly conflicts with every old aspell-dictionary
      package.  Since the dictionary format changed, libaspell15 is unable
      to coexist with older libaspell libraries as the libraries would not
      be able to share dictionaries (and quiet breakage would occur).

 -- Brian Nelson <nelson@bignachos.com>  Tue, 28 Jan 2003 16:58:30 -0800

aspell (0.50.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a Conflicts with libpspell4c102.
