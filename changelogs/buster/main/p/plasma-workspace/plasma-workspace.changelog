plasma-workspace (4:5.8.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (5.8.7)
      + [Logout Screen] Show suspend button only if supported
        Fixes KDE#376601
      + try harder to make the selected wallpaper visible
        qml gridview don't have an official way to ensure the
        current index is visible when the view is first instantiated,
        the only way we have is to do positionViewAtIndex when we know the
        proper space has already been allocated (Component.onCompleted
        is way too early) we used to do that on onCountChanged, but that
        too seems to early sometimes, as the selected wallpaper
        is visible only sometimes, attaching it to onContentHeightChanged
        seems to be more reliable (for all branches)
      + Ignore NoDisplay=true .desktop entries when matching by Name.
        We currently match Krita by Name. It's classClass is "krita",
        but its DesktopEntryName is org.kde.krita.desktop. However,
        Krita also installs numerous additional .desktop entries to
        associate more file types by itself, all of which match by
        name, and the first one in the list isn't the right one. All
        of those extra .desktop files are NoDisplay=true however, so
        we can filter them out, which brings the match list down to
        the one and only .desktop file we care for.
      + try proper order of corona()->availableScreenRect()
        connect to Plasma::Corona::availableScreenRectChanged
        instead of using kscreen, this way we should be more sure
        that signal is emitted when it's safe to call
        corona()->availableScreenRect() as the change of rect
        may happen after a screen removal, so may mean
        accessing a desktop view while being deleted
        Fixes KDE#377298
      + don't emit availableScreenRectChanged when quitting
        if applets react to it it can cause a crash, because the corona
        may not be valid anymore, and we don't want to relayout
        things anyways when tearing down
      + manage mouse events when out of the window
        mouseareas must support event grabbing when the mouse is out of the window too
        Fixes KDE#377545
      + [OSD] Allow disabling OSD through config file
      + [Calculator Runner] Use "approximate" approximation mode
        The runner calculator isn't entitled for being a scientifically correct calculator.
        This keeps seemingly innocent calculations such as "2^0.333333333" from eating all RAM until it crashes.
        A hint is added to the result if it is only an approximation.
        Fixes KDE#277011
      + Fix TasksModel.anyTaskDemandsAttention not updating on window closure.
        Previously we updated the prop after checking for
        AbstractTasksModel::IsDemandingAttention on window closure, but
        as the window is gone, we can't actually get state for it anymore,
        so we always need to update.
        To make up for it, this patch also optimizes the prop updates to occur
        only once per insert/remove batch - this is a bit academic because
        the source models currently only insert single rows at a time, but
        it's good hygiene.
        Fixes KDE#378254
      + Correctly handle when a new primary screen displaces the old
        this is for the following setup:
        the primary screen is at position 0,0 and gets disconnected.
        the other screen will be moved at 0,0 and becomes primary
        the screen is reconnected, the events arrive in the followin order:
        1) a new screen gets added, at 0,0 position
           (not primary yet, it may be markedredundant)
        2) the screen becomes primary, both screens still at 0,0
        3) the old screen gets moved out of the way
        in the end result none of the two need to be redundant.
        adding the old one in the redundant list, will cause reconsideroutputs
        to consider it and create a view for it.
      + When deleting the panel the notifications applet is in, the containment is being destroyed but the corona
        is still there and rightfully emits availableScreenRectChanged.
        This will cause us to crash when we try to access the no-longer existing containment.
        Related to KDE#378508
      + [Media Controller] Use double for length instead of int
        Length is in microseconds, so watching a long video (in excess of 33.3 minutes) will break the slider.
        CHANGELOG: Media Controller can now properly handle and seek long tracks (> 30 minutes)
        Fixes KDE#377623
      + Fix off-by-one.
        Related to KDE#373075
      + [Media Controller] Enforce PlainText format
        Unfortunately doesn't apply to toolTipMainText
      + recognize the WM even if given with a full path
        Normally kWin is launched simply as "kwin" ("kwin_x11", whatever), but
        in some cases it's restart command may be "/usr/bin/kwin", most notably
        when KWin restarts itself after a crash. Failing to recognize this client
        as the WM leads to KWin starting without any session management restoring.
        Related to KDE#377756
      + launch autostart apps in ksmserver using KRun, not QProcess
        The "move" (copy in fact) of the autostart code from klauncher simply
        switched to QProcess. This resulted in a number of problems, as the incorrect
        handling of .desktop file command if it had placeholders (worked around
        already), kdeinit is no longer used (not sure how much that matters nowadays)
        and finally QProcess simply eats all stdout/stderr of all such processes
        (which, when daemonized, can lead even to the processes getting SIGPIPE'd).
        If the application to start is a KService, simply launch it as such.
        Fixes KDE#369391,  KDE#370528 (Closes: 840478)
      + use KProcess instead of QProcess to launch apps in ksmserver
        Follow-up to the previous commit. KProcess has saner defaults for simply
        launching an app and being done with it, no lost stdout/stderr or even SIGPIPE.
        Related to KDE#369391, KDE#370528
      + selecting the topmost klipper item should always set it as clipboard contents
        Without this, that wasn't always the case if the top item was only the mouse
        selection. This was presumably broken by 2e47d84772.
        Also explicitly check the popup item, since it's now owned by Klipper.
        Fixes KDE#348390, KDE#251222
      + Revert "launch autostart apps in ksmserver using KRun"
        KRun::runApplication will show blocking error dialogs if it fails to
        find the executable
        This means we don't autostart the next app, which could be fatal if it
        comes before...
        ...kwin/plasma
        We shouldn't be having blocking calls in ksmserver it can deadlock
        And even in the best case we'd still end up blocking ksplash for 30
        seconds
        We then port to KProcess which was part of the motivation behind the
        patch as it
        has better stdout handling
        This reverts commit 0f19e92f3e85d064de9cebf280fa8e085485c2e0.
        Fixes KDE#379254
        Also added port of autostarting applications to KProcess
        It has better stdout handling
      + Update unit test to match change to reselecting top entry
        37014e643cec4ee9aed54421f66c675e1bc91b70 introduced a change in the
        behaviour of what happens when you select the top entry in the list.
        Change makes some sense. Unit test was not updated, it therefore failed.

    alternative, this way in a system without any login manager and only
    the plasma desktop installed users would be able to start plasma
    just typing 'startx'.
  * Add plasma-workspace-dbg in order to provide debugging symbols.

  * Add sddm-theme-breeze package

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * plasma-workspace relationship adjustments:
     Depends:
     + kde-cli-tools - needed to run screenlocker kcm (standalone that is)
     + kio-extras - needed for wallpaper preview generation
     + milou - needed for qml module used in krunner
     + gdb-minimal | gdb - used by drkonqi
     - libkf5declarative5 - library, should be picked up by shlibs
     - kde-wallpapers-default - kdesc4 package, 5.x wallpaper is in workspace
     - qtquick1-5-dev
     Suggests:
     - libkf5newstuff5 - only contains a lib that should be picked up by shlibs
  * Drop kde-plasma-kf5.desktop as upstream now provides an xsession file
  * Demote sddm dependency of sddm-theme-breeze to recommends. The theme is not
    worthwhile having without sddm to load it, but there is no actual
    dependency, the other way around however sddm-theme-breeze could provided
    sddm-theme to resolve sddm's theme dependency, which then defacto makes a
    circular dependency.
