proftpd (1.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sigh, now postinst moves a pre-existent old configuration
    for 1.2 series in the new location before applying ucf.
  * Now postinst adds automagically the inclusion of modules.conf to old
    config. Also revised sed calls to use in-place editing.
  * Typos in proftpd.init for logging functions corrected.
  * Template corrected to use /usr/lib/proftpd as module path.

proftpd (1.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adding a 'proftpd' user to own the daemon in proftpd.postinst.
  * Removing upstream basic.conf installated in /etc/proftpd, which
    prevented a correct template use in postinst phase.
  * Removed mod_readme in modules.conf which is already statically loaded.

proftpd (1.2.10+1.3.0rc5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The 'Here we go' release for 1.3.

  * New almost final upstream release. Definitive release would come in
    a couple of weeks or so. (closes: #353175, #349827)
  * Merging with my own experimental branch for 1.3.0 with DSO support.
    Packaging has been completely revised and simplified (no more multi-binary).
  * Moved from dbs to dpatch patching system.
  * Moved to DSO support for add-on modules.
  * Moved configuration in a /etc/proftpd directory due to the new
    style of multi-files config.
    (closes: #207136)
  * Migrated the patch-set and removed obsolete patches.

    back-compatibility for backporters, just in case.
    (closes: #343799)
  * Updated invalid de.po.
    (closes: #326799)
  * Now latest mod_ldap is backported to 1.2.10 API correctly.
    Thanks Stephan Jaeger.
    (closes: #321937)
  * Depends changed in Recommends in proftpd-common in respect with
    other proftpd-* packages.
    This will not remove proftpd-common when ever proftpd is removed, which is
    not a good thing IMHO. The whole issue will be obsoleted in the new 1.3.0
    packaging anyway, because it will remove the both proftpd-common and
    proftpd-* in upgrading.
    Note that proftpd-common installs a few common scripts.
    (closes: #341008)
  * Added 33.documentation.diff patch for a couple of minor doc issues:
    (closes: #309251,#306339)
  * Removed Paul Martin as proftpd uploader, he is not active since
    years about that.
  * Moved to level 4 compatibility for debhelper (no changes).

proftpd (1.2.10-26) unstable; urgency=low

proftpd (1.2.10-25) unstable; urgency=high

    this is superfluous in incoming 1.3.0, needed in 1.2.10.
    (closes: #334979)

proftpd (1.2.10-24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sigh. Reintroduced /dev/tty redirection for update-inetd in
    maintainer scripts. See #236595. It seems current netbase does not
    solve the problem when there is a non controlling terminal indeed. Try
    to do an upgrade/install via dsh for test.

    random signal 11
    See http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2630 for information.
    Updated again 22.mod_delay.c.diff for that.

    sendfile() fails with large files on some archs (x86_64 for instance) again.
    See http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2509 for upstream thread.
    Previous patch needs revision. Incidentally this solves also the automake
    cache inclusion.

  * New FLOSS License Exception for MySQL Server and client libraries now
    includes OpenSSL. See manual (appendix I) or
    http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/mysql-floss-license-exception.html
    So, now linking with libmysqlclient12 is allowed, debian/control changed.

    http://sf.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6255251&forum_id=2637.
    This justify urgency.

proftpd (1.2.10-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New mod_ldap from cvs (2.8.14 instead of 2.8.12). It adds the new
    LDAPProtocolVersion directive and other fixes.
    01.contrib.mod_ldap.c.diff changed to reflect this.
    Therefore, mod_ldap now works with protocols 2 or 3 and defaults to 3.
    This partially fixes #279530.
  * Patch 03.mod_ldap.c.diff removed (integrated upstream)
  * Added libpam-rutime versioned dependency in proftpd-common due to
    /etc/pam.d/common-* use which is not a woody feature. This does facilitate
    use in mixed environment, if not proper upgrades.
    Thanks Marc Moeller who pointed a problem due to that.

proftpd (1.2.9-14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added a better management of inetd/xinetd in proftpd.init script. Now
    inet/standalone/none servertype are considered. It tries to startup
    in daemon mode only if inetd/xinetd support is truly missing.
    This is not optimal, but works in the most cases. The greatest problem
    is the same pointed below: configuration status could not reflect the
    effective daemon status.
    (closes: #263247)
  * Renamed 16.dirtree,c.diff into 16.dirtree.c.diff: typo in patch name.
  * Added ipv6 related patch, again related to weird IPv6 message into
    #263247: 19.main.c.ipv6.diff. It is present in 1.2.10rc1.

proftpd (1.2.9-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * New patch: 18.mod_auth_file.c.diff
    See: http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2445
    If one uses the AuthUserFile or AuthGroupFile directive within a <Global>
    context, that directive overrides any AuthUserFile or AuthGroupFile
    directives within the "main server" or <VirtualHost> contexts. This patch
    solves that bug.
    (closes: #262697)
  * Revised proftpd.conf comments.
    (closes: #256520)
  * Added a -DHAVE_OPENSSL to CFLAGS in rules file. Apparently mysql configure
    check for SSL support but does not #define properly for mod_sql.c, which
    is anyway in contrib section. Maybe mod_sql.c needs patching.
    This hack solves the issue for what concerns Debian anyway.
    (closes: #233031)
  * Now double check for inetd/standalone mode. Daemon starts if ServerType is
    standalone or is absent _and_ ftp service is absent (or commented out) in
    inetd.conf. That's not so great, because inetd.conf could not reflect
    the current inetd status, but it's better than nothing.

proftpd (1.2.9-12) unstable; urgency=high

    instead. This freezes configure in the form issued by upstream.
    (closes: #248612)

proftpd (1.2.9-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed a duplicated build-dep (libwrap0-dev)
  * Using autotools-dev build-dep instead of autoconf

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Mon, 10 May 2004 21:12:30 +0200

proftpd (1.2.9-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Deletion of /etc/proftpd.conf on purge has been moved into
    proftpd-common.postrm. The same for all other no-return actions.
    Ratio: proftpd-common is the only package which is purged after
    removing of all bin-dep packages, not just on transitions from a bin
    package to another. Therefore that's the right place to purge things.

proftpd (1.2.9-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added mod_ifsession compilation (rules), as asked by users.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Apr 2004 20:17:30 +0200

proftpd (1.2.9-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * netbase versioning uniformed to 4.13 for each package.
  * The no-end saga of ucf, again. Version -7 missed modifications done in -6 for
    #239528, due to cvs repository outdated status.
    (closes: #244020)

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Apr 2004 13:51:47 +0200

proftpd (1.2.9-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed a double check for inetd update (proftpd.postinst)
    (closes: #242013)
  * Added an '|| true' into install_ftp (proftpd.postinst)
  * Integrating a patch to avoid an infinite loop.
    See http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2300 for patch.
    Fixed by 17.netio.c.diff
    (closes: #243071,#243277)

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Apr 2004 09:41:52 +0200

proftpd (1.2.9-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Umpf. Previuous upload did not solve the issue. It seems definitively a
    problem with ucf (Thanks Paul Slootman): --debconf-ok should be used
    only before a db_stop. Also reverted again with redirection for
    update-inetd.
    For some reason the whole problem was not so easily evident.
    (closes: #239528)
  * Previous upload missed patch 16.dirtree.c.diff due to outdated cvs
    repository on alioth.
  * Cosmetic changes into basic anon section (DirFake*).
    Other issues are secondary/outdated.
    (closes: #240209)

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Mar 2004 23:31:52 +0200

proftpd (1.2.9-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Reverted redirection of stdin and stdout for update-inetd. Also reverted
    netbase versioning dependency. Apparently workaround in current
    update-inetd does not work as it should.
    (closes: #239528)

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Mar 2004 20:14:55 +0100

proftpd (1.2.9-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Typo introduced in postrm (closes: #236963)
  * Removed redirection workaround for update-inetd (already builtin in
    netbase >=4.13).
    Changed version dependency for netbase as consequence.
    (closes: #236595)
  * Security problem (although conf dependent) fixed in patch 16.dirtree.c.diff.
    (Thanks iSteve) See
    http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2267 for hint and patch.
  * Typo in ftpstats.8 corrected (Thanks iSteve)

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Tue,  9 Mar 2004 11:50:36 +0100

proftpd (1.2.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New patch 15.mod_quotatab_sql.c.diff. (Thanks Jerome Walters)
    Bug found by Christian Schulte <cs@schulte.it>: delta values are signed,
    and can be negative.
  * Now use --debconf-ok for ucf, but needs versioning depends on ucf >= 0.30

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Feb 2004 00:11:09 +0100

proftpd (1.2.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using basic.conf from 1.2.8 series, instead of the old one with prefixed
    anonymous section.
  * Added libncurses5-dev build-dep for ftptop.
  * Policy bumped to 3.6.1 (no changes).

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Nov 2003 13:59:24 +0100

proftpd (1.2.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The first post-Halloween release now moving to sid.
    Now using upstream tarball.
  * CVS repository enabled: tagging appropriately.
  * Removed patch 14.manpages.diff: manpages are integrated in upstream
    tarballs, even if not present in CVS.
  * New patch: 14.mod_quotatab.diff: mod_quotatab 1.2.11 contributed module
    now replaces the old 1.2.7.
  * Removed 13.manpages.diff patch which is not due in off-cvs releases.
  * Tries to manage upgrades from pre-1.2.9 series in a soft way:
        - The scoreboard file format changed, so all inetd sessions need
        to be killed and file moved before restarting the service. The
        file needs to be moved for a standalone configuration, anyway.
        - SocketOptions directive replaces and deprecates the following
          directives: tcpReceiveWindow, and tcpSendWindow.

proftpd (1.2.8+cvs20031020-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * A new CVS snapshot (post 1.2.9rc3).
  * Merged stuff from unstable branch
  	- New russian template.
  	- Added a versioned dependency from debianutils to proftpd-common
   	- Removed RFCs
        - Changed order in module loading for dependencies

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 2003 23:36:58 +0200

proftpd (1.2.8+cvs20030927-1) experimental; urgency=high

  * A new CVS snapshot (post 2003-9-24 exploit).
  * Merged stuff from unstable branch (>= -9):
         - Now using case insensitive egrep in init files
         - Patches renumbered sequentially
         - Removing anonymous access enabling/disabling. A well
         commented basic configuration, to be modified by hand is much
         more effective and secure. Also that code is completely failing
         if admin changed configuration on his own, as generally done by
         everyone. So, debconf configuration is much less intrusive, and
         it's performed anyway. User 'ftp' is also added by default if
         not present, being a considered a 'system' one.

           Added a NEWS.Debian file to explain the new policy.
           Changed templates as consequence.
         - International templates revised.
         - Added strict version source dependency for proftpd-common.
         - Use proftpd.org instead of .net in control file descriptions.
         - Added NEWS.Debian as kept in unstable branch.
         - Removed 05.ftpstats.diff (unuseful).
         - Postinst revised to manage welcome.msg nicely.
  * Bugs fixed at this time (see below):

  * A new CVS snapshot. IPV6 is now integrated.
  * Removed previous patches 01.ipv6_rollback.diff and 00.ipv6.diff all IPv6
    related.

       B2.mod_sql_postgres.c.diff
       10.mod_cap.c.diff
  * Added patches:
       91.autoconf.diff - move configure.in to configure.ac to force use
       of autoconf2.50 B2.mod_sql_mysql.c.diff - use <mysql/mysql.h>
       instead of <mysql.h> B3.manpages.diff - add man pages that are
       missing in the cvs tree
  * Added autoconf build-dep.
  * Policy updated to 3.5.10.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Jun 2003 17:31:36 +0200

    Proftpd could crash in some cases when testing.
    (closes: #197585)

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Jun 2003 13:50:29 +0200

proftpd (1.2.8-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added an input (</dev/tty) redirection for ucf in maint scripts.
    (closes: #194359). This is a workaround for #193694 which is a
    debconf/ucf interaction problem.
  * Japanese podebconf template
    (closes: #194646)
  * Updated french podebconf template
    (closes: #192406)

proftpd (1.2.8-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing HTML documentation to proftpd-doc. This also clarify
    misbehaving for mod_tls.
    (closes: #150694)
  * Added mod_rewrite, mod_radius, mod_wrap to all packages. So added
    libwrap0-dev among build-deps.
    (closes: #158305)

proftpd (1.2.8-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Explicitly depends on libmysqlclient10-dev, which is the last LGPL
    licensed. Also, current sql module is not tested with mysql4, so the
    conservative approach is the safest one.
  * Introduced Replaces in control/proftpd-common against old packages.
    (closes: #188114)
  * Policy updated.
  * Maintainer script totally revised. Wow! Some more hints in basic.conf
    added too. Also a new warning note is displayed when upgrading.
    (closes: #168305, #145662, #187695, #186646, #187695)
    Debconf IS NOT a configuration tool. Now I use it only for minimal
    config interactions. We absolutely needed a more powerful config editor
    for proftpd.conf, but I seriously doubt it can be really written.
  * Introduced -q for savelog instead of stdout/stderr redirect, in
    cron.monthly.
    (closes: #188722)
  * Now truly install ftpasswd.8 among proftpd-common man pages :-/

proftpd (1.2.8-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Init file revised to use current default pidfile or PidFile directive.
    Scoreboard file name no more has the daemon pid bundled.
    (closes: #186312)
  * Now postinst changes obsolete LsDefaultOptions in ListOptions directive.
    That's needed in moving from 1.2.6 basic.conf. Added a list_options()
    function for this.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Mar 2003 11:09:00 +0100

  * Re-added mod_cap thanks to previous patch. So readded libcap-dev.
  * Patch 20.contrib.mod_ldap.c.diff revised.
    (closes: #185125, #175581,#185567)

proftpd (1.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, merging with my experimental 1.2.7 pkg...
    (closes: #185084)
    This also solve a potential seriuous license bug as stated in
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2003/debian-legal-200303/msg00287.html
    and
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2003/debian-legal-200301/msg00287.html.
  * IPv6 removed. It will be available in 1.2.9 anyway. It was also
    disabled in all releases before 1.2.6-5, so I guess it's not a
    high-requested feature :)
  * configure updated to 2.57.
  * added config.(sub|guess) cleaning.
  * Paul asked to become co-maintainer.
  * Removed patches:
  	30.libcap.change.build.dir.diff
        32.libcap.compilation.fix.diff.uue
        50.proftpd-1.2.6rc1-tls.2002.07.11.patch

    context, which got mangled by CVS, so they're now uuencoded, which
    required changes to...
  * debian/scripts/file2cat: now uudecodes files with .uue extension

    which was causing linuxprivs never to be compiled in. Thanks to
    frankie for tracing this one. (Closes: #166215)

      - signal(): remove superfluous "proftpd" in the find statement;
        (Closes: #156878)
      - Added new option "force-stop", which will try to kill proftpd even
