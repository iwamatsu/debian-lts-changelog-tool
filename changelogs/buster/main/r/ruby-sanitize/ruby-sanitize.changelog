ruby-sanitize (4.6.6-2.1~deb10u2) buster-security; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upoad by the Debian LTS team.
  * CVE-2023-36823: Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may have be able
    to sneak arbitrary HTML and CSS through Sanitize when configured to use the
    built-in "relaxed" config or when using a custom config that allowed
    "style" elements and one or more CSS "at"-rules. This could have resulted
    in cross-site scripting (XSS) or other undesired behavior if the malicious
    HTML and CSS were rendered in a browser. (Closes: #1041430)
