ruby-rails-html-sanitizer (1.0.4-1+deb10u2) buster-security; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Security Team. (Closes: #1027153)
  * CVE-2022-23517: Certain configurations use an inefficient regular
    expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when
    attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a
    denial of service through CPU resource consumption.
    Fix requires ruby-loofah >= 2.2.3-1+deb10u2.
  * CVE-2022-23518: cross-site scripting via data URIs when used in
    combination with Loofah.
    Fix requires ruby-loofah >= 2.2.3-1+deb10u2.
  * CVE-2022-23519: XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
    Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if the
    application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags in
    either of the following ways: allow both "math" and "style" elements,
    or allow both "svg" and "style" elements.
    Same fix as CVE-2022-23520.
  * CVE-2022-23520: XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
    Rails::Html::Sanitizer due to an incomplete fix of
    CVE-2022-32209. Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject
    content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's
    allowed tags to allow both "select" and "style" elements. Code is only
    impacted if allowed tags are being overridden.
    Fix requires ruby-loofah >= 2.2.3-1+deb10u2.
  * Drop patch for CVE 2022-32209, replaced by the one for
    CVE-2022-23519/23520.

ruby-rails-html-sanitizer (1.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.

  [ CÃ©dric Boutillier ]
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 9
  * Use https:// in Vcs-* fields
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.7 (no changes needed)

  [ Christian Hofstaedtler ]
  * Drop ruby-rails from Depends, as no lib code actually loads rails;
    makes the dependency cycle a little less bad.

ruby-rails-html-sanitizer (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release. Contains fixes for several XSS vulnerabilities:
    CVE-2015-7578 CVE-2015-7579 CVE-2015-7580 (Closes: #812814)
  * debian/ruby-tests.rake: re-enable test that was disabled
  * 0001-Skip-some-tests-under-Debian.patch: skip tests where the sanitized
    HTML is XSS-free but does not match the exact content expected by the
    upstream test suite. I suspect that is due to Nokogiri not using its own
    patched version of libxml2 in Debian, but can't be sure of that yet.
    Also, the same tests would already fail on 1.0.2 if enabled.

ruby-rails-html-sanitizer (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    dependency chain
