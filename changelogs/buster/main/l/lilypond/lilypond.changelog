lilypond (2.19.81+really-2.18.2-13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upload to override the accidental upload of the
    experimental version to unstable, effectivly canceling the
    2.18.2-13 upload two days ago.
    We avoid using an epoch because lilypond is expected to release
    their stable version 2.20 before the freeze of buster. The
    "+really" workaround in the Debian version number could be
    removed then.
  * Update script for doc packages
  * Add Multi-Arch: foreign to pdf packages
  * Run wrap-and-sort and cme fix dpkg
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.1.4, no changes needed

  * Fix lintian warning: Remove '--with quilt' from debhelper call
    in debian/rules. The package is already using the 3.0 (quilt)
    source format.
  * Remove unneeded patches

  [ Anthony Fok ]
  * Fix FTBFS when built with "dpkg-buildpackage -A".
    Previously, "$(MAKE) install" was not run for arch-independent build,

  [ Dr. Tobias Quathamer ]
  * Fix patch for FTBFS on hurd. Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen
    for the bug report and patch. (Closes: #761036)

  [ Anthony Fok ]
  * Bundle our own private copy of guile-1.8.  Superceded by guile-2.0,
    the old guile-1.8 was finally removed from Debian in May 2016.
    Unfortunately, LilyPond 2.18.2 still requires Guile 1.8,
    and LilyPond 2.19.x and Guile 2 are just not yet ready for each other.
    So, it would seem that bundling our own private guile-1.8 is the only
    viable option to keep LilyPond 2.18.2 in Debian for the time being.
    Hope this would allow LilyPond to re-enter Debian 9 "stretch"!
    See Bug #746005 for more information.
  * Import guile-1.8 as multiple upstream tarball component,
    originally Debian's own DFSG-compliant guile-1.8_1.8.8+1.orig.tar.bz2,
    recompressed with gzip as lilypond_2.18.2.orig-guile18.tar.gz
    (to work around current gbp limitation).
  * Add debian/gbp.conf for multiple upstream tarball (MUT)
    with special "multiple upstream tarball" (MUT) upstream-mut branch
    branch and upstream-mut/%(version)s tags for Debian 9 "stretch".
  * Cherry-pick set-global-fonts function from upstream to scm/font.scm
  * Refresh debian/control:
    - Add myself to the Uploaders field
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8 (no change)
    - Use secure https URIs for Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git fields
  * Add explicit Build-Depends on libfl-dev
    LilyPond needs /usr/include/FlexLexer.h from libfl-dev,
    but flex dependency on libfl-dev has been demoted to Recommends
    since flex (2.6.1-1.1) dated 2016-11-24.
  * Remove bitmap fonts from Build-Depends and use vector fonts only.
    Also, Build-Conflicts with fonts-noto-cjk which contains OpenType
    Collection (OTC) fonts, which unfortunately Ghostscript does not yet
    support and would cause the build to abort.
  * Make lilypond-doc-html Depends on lilypond-doc for its PNG images
  * Add "--no-parallel" to dh_auto_clean in debian/rules.
    The use of a parallel "$(MAKE) -j4 distclean" tends to fail
    after a full build.
  * Fix some minor errors and omissions in debian/copyright.
    Also add Dr. Tobias Quathamer and me as contributors to debian/*.

    to avoid a fontconfig buglet.

lilypond (2.6.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Lilypond 2.8 for Debian is currently stalled
    because guile-1.8 is required for it, and the Debian builds of
    guile-1.8 are encountering bugs.  So let's at least get the last
    lilypond-2.6 into etch in case guile-1.8 doesn't get there in time.
  * stepmake/bin/config.sub, stepmake/bin/config.guess: Use debian
    versions, from autotools-dev 20060702.1.

  * lily/include/accidental-interface.hh (Accidental_interface): Declare
    member accurate_boxes without qualification.
  * lily/include/stem.hh (Stem): Declare member beam_multiplicity without
    qualification.
  * lily/include/slur-scoring.hh (Slur_score_state): Declare member
    generate_avoid_offsets without qualification.
    (Thanks to Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com> for the patch.)
    (Closes: #357057, #387644)

  * mf/GNUmakefile (pfa_warning): Select only the first line of mftrace
    --version output for mftrace check, since mftrace now prints more than
    just one line.

  * debian/control (Build-Depends-Indep): Add ttf-bitstream-vera and
    ttf-freefont. (Many thanks to Bill Allombert <allomber@math.u-bordeaux>
    for the fix.) (Closes: #359855)

  * debian/control (Build-Depends): Require at least version 2.4.1-1 of
    libfontconfig1-dev; 2.4.0 was missing FcConfigAppFontAddDir, which we
    need.

  * debian/rules (binary-indep): Don't symlink logos anymore.

lilypond (2.6.3-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control (Build-Depends): Drop explicit dependency on
    g++-3.4.
  * debian/rules: No longer set CXX demanding g++-3.4 on certain
    archs.  (Closes: #343007)

  * debian/lilypond-data.postrm: Don't set TEXMFMAIN at all (it isn't
    used).  Don't try and set VARTEXFONTS if $1 is "purge".  Don't remove
    fonts on a purge command; it gets done at remove time and that's
    sufficient.  (All this is necessary because postrm scripts cannot
    depend on non-essential packages at purge time.)  (Closes: #325907)

  * debian/control (lilypond-data): Pre-Depends on tetex-bin to make sure
    kpsewhich is available for the maintainer scripts.  (Closes: #336052,
    #343182, #335847).

  * debian/control (Build-Depends): No longer accept libguile-dev for
    guile support, and require at least version 1.6.7 of guile-1.6-dev.
    (lilypond): Likewise here, require version 1.6.7 of guile-1.6.
    (Closes: #337597)

  * debian/control (lilypond): Spell "seamlessly" correctly.  (Closes:
    #327675)

lilypond (2.6.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Packaging suggestions from upstream:
  * debian/control (Build-Depends): Drop ec-fonts-mftraced,
    libkpathsea-dev, tetex-bin, tetex-extra.
   (Build-Depends-Indep): Add emacs-intl-fonts, xfonts-intl-arabic,
    xfonts-intl-asian, xfonts-intl-chinese, xfonts-intl-chinese-big,
    xfonts-intl-european, xfonts-intl-japanese, xfonts-intl-japanese-big,
    xfonts-intl-phonetic, ttf-kochi-gothic, ttf-kochi-mincho.  (These
    get embedded into the generated webpage.)
   (lilypond): Don't depend on ec-fonts-mftraced, tetex-bin, or tetex-extra.
   (lilypond-data): Don't depend on tetex-bin.

  * debian/control (Build-Depends): Drop long-unneeded version dependency
    on binutils and libc6-dev and its variants.

  * debian/gui-2.6.patch: New file, provided by upstream.  Applied, with
    suitable massaging of ChangeLog.
  * debian/rules, scm/lily.scm: Revert change from 2.6.3-7.

  * debian/python-2.6.patch: New file, provided by upstream.  Applied, with
    suitable massaging of ChangeLog.
  * debian/rules (install): Revert change from 3.6.3-6.

lilypond (2.6.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules (build, build-doc): Abandon attempts to have a terminal
    set as stdin.  Instead, set and export environment variable
    LILYPONDNOGUI.
  * scm/lily.scm (running-from-gui?): Return #f anytime LILYPONDNOGUI
    environment variable is set.  (Closes: #334877)

lilypond (2.6.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules (install): Move midi.so from /usr/share into /usr/lib and
    leave behind a symlink to find it.
  * debian/lilypond.install: Add usr/lib.
    (Closes: #335207)

  * debian/rules (build, build-doc): Use screen to set up a tty for input
    instead of relying on /dev/tty; that will work in more environments.
  * debian/control (Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Indep): Add screen.  Gak.

 -- Thomas Bushnell, BSG <tb@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Oct 2005 10:51:49 -0700

lilypond (2.6.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules (build, build-doc): Redirect input from /dev/tty in MAKE
    invocations.  It seems that lilypond assumes that, if stdin is not a
    terminal, we must be running under a gui.  This changes the behavior
    of the program in several fundamental ways, causing the scripts used
    for generating documentation to fail. (Closes: #334877)

 -- Thomas Bushnell, BSG <tb@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Oct 2005 20:33:11 -0700

lilypond (2.6.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control (Build-Depends): Require libfreetype6-dev,

    libc alternative.

lilypond (2.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #323526, #315970, #316125, #314242)
  * upstream-debian: holds the "debian" directory that upstream insists on
    packaging, and which makes updating versions a royal PITA.  So we'll just
    store what they do there, and then let them do what they want, and build
    ourselves for the Debian way.
  * debian/rules (binary-indep): No longer look for lilypond.map file or
    install it.
  * debian/lilypond-data.dirs: Drop etc/texmf/dvips.
  * debian/watch: Look in the v2.6 download directory now.
  * debian/lilypond.install: Don't worry about usr/lib anymore.
  * debian/rules (binary-indep): No longer does upstream build PS docs, so
    we no longer make symlinks to them.

  * debian/control (clean): Remove annoying lib/python symlink.

  * debian/control (lilypond): Update description to mention SVG.

  * debian/control (lilypond1.3): Drop transitional package.
  * debian/lilypond1.3.copyright: Remove file.  (Closes: #308709)
  * debian/control (lilypond): Don't conflict with lilypond1.3 or
    musixtex-fonts anymore.

  * debian/control (lilypond-data): Depend on texinfo | texlive-texinfo.
  * debian/rules (install): Don't install texinfo.tex.  (Closes: #322338)

  * debian/control (Build-Depends): Require version 0.0.20050911-1 of
    fontforge, or greater, to avoid crashes during building.

  * debian/control (Build-Depends): Require at least version 1.1.17-1 of
    mftrace, to avoid a gcc4-related bug that was only fixed in that version.

  * debian/control: Build-Depends on autotrace.  (Closes: #289376).

  * mf/GNUmakefile (.pfa generic rule): Use "--formats=pfa" instead of "--pfa."
  * stepmake/metafont-rules.make: Likewise; also for .pfb generic rule.
  * debian/control: Require at least version 1.1.5-1 of mftrace.

lilypond (2.2.6-2.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload during BSP
  * Version build-dep on fontforge, only newest upstream seems to be able to
    build this package. Thanks Bastian Kleineidam <calvin@debian.org> for
    fixing fontforge and suggesting this fix (Closes:#278502)

lilypond (2.2.6-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added the Werner Lemberg's Asian scripts examples.  He e-mailed me
    and said, "I suggest that you add the two example files to the
    Debian package also -- the mailing list archive of the lilypond
    list shows garbage only (at least for me)."  Yes, ditto here.
    So yes, xiao-haizi-guai-guai.ly and sakura-sakura.ly are in!  :-)
  * The "-sDEVICE=bbox" bug has been fixed in gs-gpl (8.01-5), so I have
    adjusted debian/control accordingly.  (Note to self: Need to check
    gs-afpl (8.14-3) to see if it too can be taken off the blacklist.)

  * Special thanks to Daniel Burrows for the previous NMUs!  :-)
    (Closes: #257335, #261861)

  * Thanks to Ferenc Wagner for letting me know of some packaging bugs
    that I have introduced over the years:
     - Removed obsolete MAKE_PFA_FILES=1 from "make" invocations.
     - s/--enable-optimise/--enable-optimising/;
     - Removed Build-Depends: autotrace; mftrace prefers potrace.

    location of the info files in the doc-base file. (Closes: #257335)

    - Thanks to Pedro Kroeger for providing interim sid packages while
      I was away for an extended period of time.
  * Copied some ideas from Ferenc Wagner's LilyPond for woody (Thanks!):
     - Split out shared data to lilypond-data package.  (Closes: Bug#233406)

    Thanks to Daniel Schepler for the report.  (Closes: Bug#193065)
  * debian/rules: Revert to calling ./configure rather than ./autogen.sh.
  * An issue with autoconf <= 2.57 and g++ >= 3.3 has been preventing

    - Depend on mftrace (>= 1.0.17-1) instead of pktrace.
    - Add guile-1.6-dev as alternative dependency to libguile-dev
    - Bugfix for docdir when with changed package name.
    - Remove bibtex2html dependencies.  (LilyPond has come with its own
      bib2html for some time now.  However, xpmtoppm and pnmtopng from
      netpbm is still needed - foka)
    - Remove gcc-3.x/lexer kludge.
  * midi2ly.1 was empty because help2man calls midi2ly but it couldn't
    "import midi": python/out/midi.so wasn't built until later.  Added
    a kludge in debian/rules to regenerate midi2ly.1 manually.

lilypond (1.4.12-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream maintenance release.
  * Several important fixes (including our bison-related patch added
    to 1.4.10-1) are included since 1.4.11 this release.  (Now, I
    don't even need to increase teTeX's extra_mem_top, extra_mem_bot
    or pool_size!  :-)  Please include in Woody.
  * Fixed a typo in lilypond-doc package description: typestting ->
    typesetting.  Thanks, Matt Zimmerman!  (Closes: Bug#125083)

lilypond (1.4.10-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * lilypond failed to build with bison >= 1.30 because bison's output file
    has been renamed.  Applied an upstream fix.  (Closes: Bug#133692)
  * lilypond's documentation also failed to build with the latest
    tetex or texinfo package.  Instead of increasing extra_mem_top and
    extra_mem_bot, increasing pool_size does the trick.

lilypond (1.4.9-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * Oops, libc6-dev is known as libc6.1-dev and libc-dev on some
    architectures.  Fixed Build-Depends so that lilypond can be built
    on all platforms.  Thanks to Colin Watson for reporting the bug.
    (Closes: Bug#120208)

lilypond (1.4.8-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * [debian/rules]: Use -s instead of -a so that lilypond would get built
     on all architectures even when the dummy lilypond1.3 package isn't
     built.  Thanks to Ryan Murray for the report.  (Closes: Bug#117622)
  * Depends on python instead of python-base.  The python scripts in
    lilypond work with old and new Python versions.
  * Build-Depends on "-z combreloc"-enabled binutils (>= 2.11.92.0.10-2)
    and libc6-dev (>= 2.2.4-5) so that lily runs faster!  :-)

lilypond (1.4.8-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: Bug#111132)
  * Stopped using $(PWD) in make, as it doesn't seems to work on
    potato systems with older "make".  Reverted to `pwd`.
    Thanks to Wolfgang Schnitker for notifying me this problem.
  * Changed the lilypond1.3 dummy package's Architecture from "all"
    to "arm i386 m68k powerpc sparc".  Also, as upstream updated
    config.sub and config.guess to recognize ia64 and hppa.
    Thanks to Anthony Towns for the bug report.  (Closes: Bug#114266)
  * Versioned Build-Depends: flex (>= 2.5.4a-14) to ensure gcc-3.0
    compatibility.

lilypond (1.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream includes lexer-gcc-3.0.patch which should fix compilation

    Updated Build-Depends.

lilypond (1.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * Urgency high because LilyPond-1.2.17 is too buggy and yet it has
    been stuck in testing forever.  LilyPond-1.4.x fixes multiple
    serious bugs.  :-)
  * Ah, silly me, lilypond was conflicting against itself!  I forgot
    to remove this relics during the switch from lilypond1.3 to lilypond.
  * Fixed a new bug in lily/main.cc which caused lilypond to skip over every
    other command-line argument.
  * [configure.in]: Added -mieee to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS when building on
     Alpha to prevent FP exception.  Thanks to Christopher C. Chimelis
     for the fix!

lilypond (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Moved "bibtex2html, gs | gs-aladdin, netpbm (>= 2:9.10-1)"
    from Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep because these packages
    are only needed for building lilypond-doc.

lilypond (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: Bug#97598)
  * export extra_mem_top=100000 and extra_mem_bot=100000, otherwise
    latex runs out of memory when processing standchen.dvi.latex.
  * Split the documentation into the "lilypond-doc" package, which
    provides the LilyPond website in /usr/share/doc/lilypond/html.

lilypond (1.3.150-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Renamed package from lilypond1.3 back to lilypond.
    This also fixes a lot of bugs from the old lilypond-1.2.17 package.
    lilypond1.3 is temporarily provided as a dummy transitional package.
    Closes: Bug#67697, 84352, 48731, 72223, 85834.
  * [debian/rules]:
     - No longer blindly copy intermediate DVI files into
       the deb package.  Thanks to Daniel Burrows for the reminder.
       Closes: Bug#87852.
     - Added "export MODE=ljfour" and "export BDPI=600" because I use
       something different in my local /etc/texmf/mktex.cnf and that
       broke the build.
  * Fixed Build-Depends because pnmtopng has been merged into the netpbm
    package.  Thanks to Adrian Bunk for the notice.  Closes: Bug#93961.
  * [lily/kpath.cc]: Modified to better conform to web2c fontpath policy.

    a dear friend, a kind educator, and a hard worker in sharing beautiful
    typeset music to the world.  (Maintainer of the GMD Music Archive,

  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream has changed from "lilypond-mode" to the "studly caps name"
    "LilyPond-mode".  Fixed /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50lilypond1.3.el
    (debian/emacsen-startup).  Thanks to Christophe Rhodes for the bug
    report.  Closes: Bug#83732.
  * Added "Build-Conflicts: lilypond, lilypond1.3" to prevent old
    lilypond font files from potentially interfering with the build on
    other Debian ports autobuilders.
  * Built with libguile-dev (1:1.4-9) or newer to ensure correct
    linkage to libqthreads.so.9.  Also updated the Build-Depends and
    Depends fields accordingly.  Thanks to guile1.4 package maintainer
    Rob Browning for his notification and to Daniel Burrows for his bug
    report.  Closes: Bug#85896.

    in Documentation/topdocs/INSTALL.texi (hence INSTALL.txt).
  * Applied Han-wen's one-line patch to lily/system-start-delimiter.cc
    to remove bracket-width.

    scm/grob-description.scm and scm/interface-description.scm too.

  * Known problem: LilyPond simply segfaults under glibc 2.1 on my i386

    other platforms have better luck.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - Make and install info files.
      - Removed "CC=egcc" because the default gcc on all platforms is

lilypond (1.0.18-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug-fix release.
  * [debian/control]:
      - Upgraded to standards version 2.5.0.0 (no changes).
      - Recommends: python-misc (>= 1.5.1) because ly2dvi needs the glob
        module in the python-misc package (closes: Bug#29283).
      - Updated dependencies on tetex* to the latest versions:
          Depends: tetex-bin (>= 0.9.981031-2)
          Recommends: tetex-base (>= 0.9.981030-1)
        due to changes in tetex's directory structure.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - The symlink ../../../../../share/lilypond/mf is now named
        /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/source/public/lilypond instead of
        /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/source/public/mf (Bug#29284).
      - In the latest tetex-base package, /usr/lib/texmf/doc is now a
        symlink to /usr/doc/texmf.  Therefore, we now install lilypond's
        documentation into /usr/doc/texmf/musixtex/lilypond.
        (closes: Bug#28999, Bug#29326)
  * [debian/preinst]:
      - The script now removes the directories
        /var/spool/texmf/pk/*/public/mf and /var/spool/texmf/tfm/public/mf
        created inadvertently by Debian's buggy lilypond 1.0.17-1.  :-)
        (Bug#29284)
      - Since 1.0.17-1, /usr/lib/texmf/tex/lilypond has been changed to a
        symbolic directory.  The script now removes the old real directory
        to prevent problems during upgrade (closes: Bug#29284).
  * [debian/postinst]: I copied a few lines from tetex-nonfree's postinst
      to remove the old directory /usr/lib/texmf/doc if lilypond is the
      last package to use that directory, and create a symlink to
      /usr/doc/texmf.  :-)
  * Rebuilt with yodl (1.31.7-1) installed to ensure the documentations
    are compiled properly (closes: Bug#29285).
  * Thanks to Fabien Ninoles <fab@tzone.org>, Roland Rosenfeld
    <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> and Julian Gilbey <jdg@maths.qmw.ac.uk>
    for reporting the bugs listed above. :-)

        run.  Thanks to Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
        for reporting the problem!  (closes: Bug#27044)
      - Updated debian/rules according to the new debhelper rules example.
      - Now configures with --disable-optimise instead of --enable-optimise,
        otherwise it would not compile.
      - Added symlinks to directories under /usr/lib/texmf because lilypond
        now puts everything under /usr/share/lilypond.
  * [Documentation/topdocs/AUTHORS.yo]: Added a trailing "/" on URLs.
  * [scripts/ly2dvi.py]: Added a hack to add an extra os.pathsep (":" on
      Linux) to TEXINPUTS and MFINPUTS, otherwise ly2dvi and TeX would fail
      to find the necessary files.
  * Compiled with libstdc++2.9.  :-)

lilypond (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * [aclocal.m4]: Temporarily changed OPTIMIZE="-O2" to OPTIMIZE="-O"
      to avoid egcs (c++) complaint of "Internal compiler error"
      on my computer.
  * [scripts/mudela-book.py]: Added "#!@PYTHON@" at the top.  This string
      expands to "#!/usr/bin/python" in /usr/bin/mudela-book.
      (Thanks to Lintian.  :-)
  * [debian/control]: Recommends: python-base (>= 1.5.1).
      (Again, thanks to Lintian.  :-)
  * [debian/postrm]: Now also removes the generated LilyPond fonts
      *.{tfm,pk} under /var/spool/texmf when called as "postrm remove".
  * [debian/preinst]: Yes, have to bring this back to remove the generated
      LilyPond fonts in /var/spool/texmf because "postrm remove" didn't do
      its jobs in previous versions.  Oops.  :-)
  * [debian/rules]: Installs a few new upstream documentation files, and
      the example files in out/ directories are moved to parent directories.

lilypond (0.1.60-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release with lots of bug fixes, including the MIDI
    generation bug in 0.1.48.  Please put this in Hamm.
  * debian/control:
     - Upgraded to standards version 2.4.1.0 (no changes).
  * debian/rules:
     - lilypond now also depends on tetex-base (>= 0.9-5)
       and conflicts with tetex-base (<< 0.9).
  * Modified postinst and postrm to work with teTeX 0.9 / Web2C 7.2:
     - Removed all the *ugly* kludges and functions that were supposed to
       deal with non-Debian teTeX installations.  Those kludges were
       specifically made for teTeX 0.4, but they failed to work as intended
       due to the changes in teTeX 0.9.
     - No longer messes with special.map because the standard
       Web2C 7.2 special.map already lists the feta fonts.
     - Since postinst is so much simpler, it is now a sh script!  :-)
  * Removed preinst which contained yet another obsolete kludge to clean
    obsolete/ancient lilypond fonts.
  * Updated the GNU LilyPond Home Page URIs.

lilypond (0.1.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream "The Utrecht Release".
  * Compiled on va.debian.org because egcs 1.0.1 on my computer
    no longer comes with libg++.  :-(  But hey, va.debian.org
    sure is fast!  <grin>
  * Temporarily includes *.xpm instead of *.gif files because
    the netpbm package is not installed on va.debian.org, and
    also because it violates Policy 2.1.2.  Thanks to
    James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk> for bug report!  :-)
    (Fixes Bug#18212)

       LilyPond no longer needs them.
     - Therefore, Section: is changed from "contrib/tex" to "tex".
       LilyPond can finally go into the main distribution.  Hurray!
  * debian/rules: Now also dh_installdocs ANNOUNCE-0.1 and ONEWS.

lilypond (0.1.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Applied a small fix to postinst.  The font-entries-search-and-replace
    add_fonts() subroutine was slightly buggy.
  * Unpatched ./configure.  It turned out that I spelt "--enable-optimise"
    as "--enable-optimize" in debian/rules by mistake.  Oops!  :)  Thanks
    to the upstream author for pointing this out!  :)
  * The upstream authors has included the ./debian/* files in the pristine
    source archive!  They also fixed some minor errors in README.debian
    and copyright.  Thanks a lot!  :)
  * Removed the line "dh_clean" from "binary-arch:" and switched the order
    of dh_clean in "clean:" in debian/rules.  dh_clean was deleting
    the zero-byte file ./make/out/Site.make, causing the build to fail.

    (I will discuss it with the upstream author.)
  * Adapted postinst (a Perl script) from the musixtex package for lilypond.
    Now postinst adds the new LilyPond font entries into
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
  * Added preinst to clean up my mess from previous releases: the old
    "stray" automatically generated TFM and PK font files were placed in
    the wrong directories because they were not listed in
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
  * Did some minor clean-up in debian/rules and switched to debhelper.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 2.3.0.1
