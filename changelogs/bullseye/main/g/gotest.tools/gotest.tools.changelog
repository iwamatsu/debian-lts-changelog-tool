gotest.tools (2.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Set DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES_ALL to false in debian/rules
    so that assert/cmd and icmd/internal/stub are included in the final deb
    with debhelper-compat (= 12).  Fixes autopkgtest regression.
  * Apply "cme fix dpkg" formatting to debian/control
  * Add myself to the list of Uploaders
  * Skip nondeterministic TestDeepEqual in assert/cmp/compare_test.go.
    go-cmp 0.3.0 deliberately returns a nondeterministic report string,
    randomly alternating between regular space (U+0020) and non-breaking
    space (U+00A0) for indents, so TestDeepEqual is now very flakey.
    See https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotest.tools/pull/158
    and https://github.com/google/go-cmp/pull/124 for the whole story.
