    and updatedb.sh.
  * Don't install .htaccess into /usr/share/roundcube.  The root directory for
    the HTTPd is /var/lib/roundcube and already ship the htaccess there.
  * Don't install the installer into /usr/share/roundcube.

  * d/watch: Monitor git tags rather than release tarballs.
  * d/gbp.conf: Add upstream VCS tag as additional parent to upstream/$VERSION.
  * d/gbp.conf: Rename upstream branch to upstream/release-1.4.
  * Recommend using new directory /var/lib/roundcube/public_html as document
    root.
  * Update d/*.README.Debian with current instructions.
  * Run the upstream test suite (excluding Selenium-based web tests) at build
    time (unless under 'nocheck' build profile).  This adds phpunit,
    php-masterminds-html5 and php-intl to Build-Depends.
  * Add DEP-8 tests.  For now this only consists of the upstream test suite
    (excluding Selenium-based web tests).
  * Replace Build-Depends: closure-compiler, yui-compressor with cleancss,
    uglifyjs (>=3), used respectively for CSS and Javascript minification.
    Build also source maps alongside the minified code.  (Closes: #978073)
  * Elastic skin: Ship non-minified CSS and sourcemap alongside Less source
    files.  (Closes: #978070)
  * New Build-Depends: pigz.  Ship gzipped (minified) JS and CSS files along
    side the non-compressed versions.  Compatible HTTPds can send these files
    as is in order to avoid on-the-fly compression overhead.

  * d/rules: Exclude TinyMCE language Javascript packs from minification as
    Roundcube and TinyMCE load $code.js files not $code.min.js.
  * d/patches: Rename Use-system-JQueryUI.patch to use-system-JQueryUI.patch.
  * Bundle TinyCME as secondary orig tarballs (downloaded automatically using
    custom uscan(1) script) rather than in d/missing-sources.  The TinyCME zip
    archive we used to ship in d/missing-sources violates DFSG (since
    1.3.0+dfsg.1-1), because upstream's jsdeps.json links to the so-called
    "production package" which doesn't include preferred sources of
    modification.  This remained unnoticed because lintian doesn't inspect the
    content of archives in d/missing-sources.  Unfortunately Roundcube is
    still too dependent on the TinyCME version for us to switch to the
    packaged version (see #784351), so we use secondary tarballs (repacked to
    exclude generated files such as minified JS and CSS files) for now.
  * d/control: Bump minimum node-less version to 3.0.0 as for later versions
    evaluation of JavaScript inline is disabled by default unless the new --js

  * d/po/de.po: Convert from ISO-8859-15 to TDF-8.
  * Remove bundled OpenPGP.js as the bundled source is not the preferred form
    of modification hence violates DFSG.  This breaks key generation in the
    enigma plugin (server-side OpenPGP support), but other key operations
    (incl. import of private keys) still work.  That being said enigma is
    already broken in Buster (and Bullseye too right now) due to the missing
    dependency 'php-crypt-gpg'.  Admins wanting enigma already need to
    manually install the dependency; they'll now need to also copy

        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/v4.4.6/dist/openpgp.min.js

    (or a later version) to /usr/share/roundcube/plugins/enigma/openpgp.min.js

  * d/copyright: Upgrade URLs to secure HTTP.
  * d/copyright: Simplify Files-Excluded: pattern for generated JS files.  Add
    new helper script d/origtargz-diff.sh to make sure we ship all files:
    generated files from the upstream tarball (before repacking) are excluded
    from the repacked .orig tarball, so we need to generate them back at build
    time and install them somewhere.
  * d/rules: Replace `find -print0 | xargs -r0` calls and loops with `find
    -exec`.
  * d/rules: Minify CSS files ourselves (like for .js files we minify all
    files, even the ones for which there is no .min.css in the upstream tree).
  * d/rules: Add yui-compressor to Build-Depends: for CSS minification.
  * d/patches/debianize-config.patch: typofix (closes: #931909).
  * d/rules: Also (re-)minify CSS/JS in roundcube-plugins, not only in
    roundcube-core.  The upstream tarball contains multiple plugins/*/*.min.js
    files before repacking, and while Roundcube seems to manage without, there
    are no reasons not to re-minify these in additions to the files in -core.
  * d/roundcube-core.preinst: Drop logic to remove old symlinks with file
    targets (.js, .txt etc.) as dpkg is able to handle these on its own.
  * d/roundcube-core.{pre,post}inst: Drop logic to handle upgrade path from
    ancient versions (<oldstable).  We don't support these upgrade paths and
    it clutters the maintainer scripts.
  * d/roundcube-core.maintscript: Ensure smooth directory-to-symlink
    conversion.  This is required for upgrades from <1.4~.
  * d/roundcube-core.dirs: Remove var/lib/roundcube/config as dh_link will
    create a symlink to etc/roundcube with that name.

roundcube (0.5-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * If 0.3.1 was installed from scratch, upgrade does not work on MySQL
    and PostgreSQL because we try to create an index which already
    exists. With SQLite, the error is ignored, no fix needed. When using
    PostgreSQL, fix this by dropping the index if it already
    exists. Nothing similar seems to exist with MySQL. Therefore, just
    don't create the index. We need to handle this later. See bug
    #610725. Not closing.

     + Update SQL commands to use to upgrade database.
       That also closes: #602922. Unfortunately, the user may get some
       harmless error messages because there is no way to know if
       0.3.1 was installed from scratch or upgraded from 0.3.
     + Update dependencies to match INSTALL file. Only exception is the
       use of Mail_Mime 1.8.0 in place of 1.8.1 which is not available in
       Debian. We depends on jQuery 1.4.2 because 1.4.4 is not available in
       Debian.
     + All folders are correctly checked since 0.4. Closes: #552430.
     + Also, closes: #553194 since it seems to have been fixed too.
     + There is also the possibility to not top-quote since 0.4.
       Closes: #491063.
     + Closes: #602144. Also fixed.

     - It also fixes the deletion of multiple messages, still with
       bincimap (Closes: #451404)

    merged upstream.

    in Debian yet. We switch back to old backend.

  * Add support for lighttpd and remove support for older version of
    Apache. The debconf question about webserver autoconfiguration is
    reworded (Closes: #462961).
  * Do not depend on a specific revision of cdbs.
  * Move po-debconf from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends since it is
    needed for clean target.
