ruby-rails-html-sanitizer (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.

    - Add Build-Dependency on debhelper-compat.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 4.5.0.
    - Use my debian.org mail address.
    - Declare that the build doesn't need root.

ruby-rails-html-sanitizer (1.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.

  [ CÃ©dric Boutillier ]
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 9
  * Use https:// in Vcs-* fields
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.7 (no changes needed)

  [ Christian Hofstaedtler ]
  * Drop ruby-rails from Depends, as no lib code actually loads rails;
    makes the dependency cycle a little less bad.

ruby-rails-html-sanitizer (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release. Contains fixes for several XSS vulnerabilities:
    CVE-2015-7578 CVE-2015-7579 CVE-2015-7580 (Closes: #812814)
  * debian/ruby-tests.rake: re-enable test that was disabled
  * 0001-Skip-some-tests-under-Debian.patch: skip tests where the sanitized
    HTML is XSS-free but does not match the exact content expected by the
    upstream test suite. I suspect that is due to Nokogiri not using its own
    patched version of libxml2 in Debian, but can't be sure of that yet.
    Also, the same tests would already fail on 1.0.2 if enabled.

ruby-rails-html-sanitizer (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    dependency chain
